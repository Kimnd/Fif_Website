 <p>~~~Loop One: Welcome to Bullworth~~~ </p>
<p >
        I was ripped from a pleasant dream by a gentle dive-bomb to my vital organs. &ldquo;HOOF OW!&rdquo; <em>Well, that&rsquo;s one way to wake up.</em>
     
</p>
<p >&ldquo;Rise and shine, Femme Boy!&rdquo; I groaned in pain, trying to shake off the dregs of sleep that still clung to my brain. &ldquo;Time for another fun-filled week of the highest-quality education available to donkeys anywhere!&rdquo; As far as I could tell, Gary thought that a stream of insults was the best way to wake up. </p>
<p >I just turned over in response to my roommate&rsquo;s greeting. So, Gary whipped my quilt onto the floor, making me curl up into myself trying to retain the warmth of sleep. &ldquo;Come <em>on</em>, Petey, you can always get back to your stupid, girly fantasies later, mmkay?&rdquo; <em>Why does he sound so </em>chipper<em>, ughhh&hellip;</em> </p>
<p >I raised my head, groaning out, &ldquo;Okay, okay, I&rsquo;m up...&rdquo; Gary must&rsquo;ve taken me at my word, since I could hear him droning on about something as my head hit the pillow again. Thank God. Jesus, does he wake up at some ungodly hour and just wait to make me get up? </p>
<p >I mumbled an &ldquo;Mm-hm&rdquo; so he&rsquo;d assume I was still listening. Hazarding a glance at my watch, I found that, yep, right before seven. <em>Sigh</em>. &ldquo;..new kid we were discussing? Hopkins?&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; I glanced up, and&mdash;to my surprise&mdash;he seemed to expect a response. &ldquo;Oh um.&rdquo; I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to remember. Oh yeah, &ldquo;That kid who&rsquo;s been kicked out of, like, a bazillion schools?&rdquo; I yawned, and figured I&rsquo;d better get out of bed if I wanted to avoid just falling back to sleep. &ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s voice became slightly muffled as he pulled his shirt on over his head. &ldquo;Rumor has it that he&rsquo;s going to be arriving here <em>today</em>,&rdquo; His face popped through his shirt sporting one of the largest grins I had ever seen. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that sound exciting, Petey?&rdquo; I was about to voice my agreement, but he didn&rsquo;t give me the chance. &ldquo;Knowing this school, I already know how to get him on my good side. If everything goes well, I might even be able to get him to not hate you, Femme Boy!&rdquo; He glanced up from his packing appraisingly before smirking. &ldquo;Well, at least keep him from wanting to kick your head in.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Because there&rsquo;s just a line of people who want to beat the shit out of me for some reason. &ldquo;Whatever, Gary,&rdquo; And I finally pushed myself up so I could swing my legs out of bed to get ready for the day. </p>
<p >He shook his head, tsking. &ldquo;Really, Petey? Don&rsquo;t you have anything <em>better</em> to say?&rdquo; I would&rsquo;ve responded, but I was interrupted by a large yawn. &ldquo;Honestly, you should show a little more gratitude!&rdquo; <em>&hellip;what the hell is he talking about?</em> I watched Gary throw the last book into his pack with a huff through one eye, trying to rub eye-boogers out of the other. Gary threw the bag over his shoulder as he stood, speaking as if I were being the ridiculous one here. &ldquo;Not a lot of people would be willing to take you under their wing like I have, you know,&rdquo; He then mock-fluttered his eyelashes in my direction, smirking all the while. </p>
<p >I rolled my eyes at the &lsquo;flirting&rsquo;, but couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from quietly adding &ldquo;Yeah, who wouldn&rsquo;t want somebody else constantly following them around, making fun of them&hellip;&rdquo; I started fumbling with the latch on my wardrobe, trying to wake myself up enough to get dressed. </p>
<p >Gary was strangely silent after that, which made me turn toward him nervously. He was frowning at me&mdash;he said in a far less jovial tone &ldquo;Wow, Petey&mdash;that&rsquo;s rather mean of you to say. Do you talk to all your friends like that, or am I just special?&rdquo; I blinked, a little surprised. <em>We&rsquo;re friends? Since when?</em> But before I could reply, Gary held up a hand and turned dramatically toward the door, like he had better things to do. &ldquo;Know what, don&rsquo;t bother, Femme Boy. I&rsquo;ll just assume you&rsquo;re PSMing,&rdquo; I groaned, glaring at him out of the corner of his eye, but what was I going to do about it? He grinned when he saw my glare as he walked out the door, waving cheerily before he took his leave. </p>
<p >I sighed. <em>Good riddance. </em>I don&rsquo;t <em>hate</em> Gary, but being around him for too long, or too early in the morning, tends to make my head hurt. I&rsquo;ve only been here for two weeks and it feels like he never leaves me alone. I sighed to myself as I got ready for the day, thinking about all the rumors that&rsquo;d been swirling around about the new kid. It&rsquo;s a shame, since it&rsquo;s really not fair to him. I&rsquo;d be willing to be that nobody will even give him much of a chance. Christ, I can&rsquo;t imagine arriving at a place where complete strangers had already decided they hate me; just changing from homeschool to Bullworth has been bad enough.... </p>
<p >Gary, of course, is the exact opposite to me&mdash;the first time I&rsquo;d seen him in the dorm, he had been sitting on the couch, listening in on every conversation in the common room just enough so that he could butt into four conversations at once. Honestly, Gary can be pretty funny sometimes, even if his sense of humor runs way darker than mine. Plus, he&rsquo;d sort of taken me under his wing, showing me the ins-and-outs of the cliques, sitting with me in the cafeteria, stuff like that. Which is no small thing&mdash;moving from homeschool to a regular school is tough enough, so having somebody I at least knew in passing is&hellip; comforting. And, honestly, as far as nick-names go, it could really be a lot worse than &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo;. </p>
<p >Eventually, my train of thought drifted back to the new kid as I zipped up my book bag. Gary seemed pretty keen on befriending him; he hadn&rsquo;t talked about anything else since the rumor started circulating. </p>
<p >Finally making my way to the door, I got an idea; maybe the three of us could be friends<em> together</em>! That put a smile on my face despite myself, and I felt a bit lighter as stepped into the hallway. </p>
<p >Ha. If I had only known what was to come. </p>
<p >~~~~~~~~~~~~ </p>
<p >The common room had finally emptied out long after the sun had stopped lighting the grime-encrusted windows and the &ldquo;SKOOLZ OWT 4 EVAH!&rdquo; banner. I usually don&rsquo;t stay up this late, but Jimmy kept dragging me back to hear various people&rsquo;s stories, praise, and just making me participate in the general celebration. And hey, it <em>was</em> a party&mdash;I don&rsquo;t get to go to one this big very often. And even though all I&rsquo;d really wanted was to go to sleep, at least Jimmy was trying to include me now. </p>
<p >But we were the only people up now&mdash;even that guy with the sleep problems was passed out on the couch. I was picking through the leftover snacks on the poker table, and Jimmy was doing that leaning-against-the-wall-while-sitting-in-a-chair thing. &ldquo;Wow, what a day, eh Petey?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I smiled wryly. &ldquo;Ha, I think that&rsquo;s a bit of an understatement.&rdquo; He laughed as I extracted a licorice stick from under the pile of junk food. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Hm, yeah..&rdquo; Where did it all go so wrong? For a couple minutes, I got lost in thought as I tried to remember&mdash;something I&rsquo;d been asking a lot of nights lately. &ldquo;&hellip;how come you&rsquo;re so quiet?&rdquo; Jimmy broke my train of though a little, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you happy we won?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I started at that. &ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;we won&rsquo;?&rdquo; I stared at Jimmy in mild confusion. </p>
<p >He reflected my own confusion, &ldquo;Whad&rsquo;ya mean, &lsquo;what do I mean&rsquo;? We beat Gary! He got shipped off to Happy Volts, you&rsquo;re fuckin&rsquo; Head Boy, the cliques&rsquo;ve been dissolved, we won!&rdquo; His eyes narrowed in what could have easily been annoyance or confusion. &ldquo;What, are you still looking out for that girlfriend?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I flinched and hoped my embarrassment wasn&rsquo;t too apparent when I shook my head. &ldquo;No, no, not that, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; I started counting my points off finger-by-finger. &ldquo;Well, Gary got shipped off to an insanity asylum where he&rsquo;ll probably get way worse before he gets any better, you&rsquo;re going to have to spend the next three years keeping people from getting into fights, and&hellip; well&hellip;&rdquo; I sighed, letting my hand drop. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s face it, I doubt <em>any</em> title is going to get <em>me</em> any respect.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy scrutinized me a little before snorting. &ldquo;Geez, Petey, that&rsquo;s kinda harsh.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I shrugged, chuckling dryly. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;ve learned anything from attending this school, &lsquo;the world is harsh&rsquo; is it.&rdquo; He nodded in a <em>that&rsquo;s fair</em> sort of way. I looked down, sighing. &ldquo;I guess I just don&rsquo;t feel like anybody really <em>won</em>. I mean, don&rsquo;t you wish Gary hadn&rsquo;t been so crazy and had just stayed friends with us?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy crossed his arms, glaring at the snack pile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never be friends with that motherfucker.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I nodded&mdash;after what had happened this year, I could empathize. &ldquo;I know what you mean, but what if Gary had never betrayed you? What would have happened? Could we have convinced him we really were his friends?&rdquo; Jimmy laughed harshly at that, giving me a patronizing glance. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Come on, man&mdash;&rdquo; He shook his head at my apparent naivet&eacute;. &ldquo;Gary <em>never</em> thought we were friends. He just wanted to use us to take over the school.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I sighed exasperatedly, turning my body in his direction, trying to convey my idea. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the thing&hellip; I get why he&rsquo;d want to use <em>you</em>, but why would he want to use me?&rdquo; Jimmy&rsquo;s amusement disappeared as I continued &ldquo;I mean sure, Gary and I had met before this year started, but I didn&rsquo;t know him that well&mdash;I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t call us &lsquo;friends&rsquo;. He just kinda pushed me around whenever we came into contact around town. But we <em>had</em> talked before, and he knew I couldn&rsquo;t fight or anything,&rdquo; I gestured emphatically and continued. &ldquo;So then why would Gary start planning this&hellip; thing, to somehow include me?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say to that. &ldquo;Come on, who wouldn&rsquo;t want you on their side?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I threw my hands up in a mock-shrug. &ldquo;Uh, somebody who needed to beat up more than half the school in order to accomplish their goal? I&rsquo;m just saying, <em>Peter Kowalski</em> is a terrible choice if you&rsquo;re trying to control a school full of people who&rsquo;re really good at punching each other. For somebody who&rsquo;s so smart, you&rsquo;d think that Gary would want somebody who was, I dunno, good at networking, like the red-headed girl, or somebody who&rsquo;s good at tactics, like one of the Nerds.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy replied slowly &ldquo;I guess? &hellip;So what&rsquo;re you sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I sighed, leaning back. That rant had kind of exhausted me&mdash;there&rsquo;s always <em>something</em>. &ldquo;I dunno. I guess I just want to know <em>why</em> all the crazy shit this year happened!&rdquo; I looked over at him . &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know why?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He shrugged, reaching for a candy bar. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really care. I mean, isn&rsquo;t Gary being a fucking asshole explanation enough?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I shook my head. &ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s an asshole, but he&rsquo;s <em>smart</em> about it. He&rsquo;s only openly douchey to people who are too weak to be a problem for him, like me, or that he thinks are too &lsquo;dumb&rsquo; to care, like you,&rdquo; Jimmy paused in ripping the wrapping off the bar to give me a glare, and I was quick to back-pedal. &ldquo;Not that you are, obviously! I&rsquo;m just trying to think the way that Gary would.&rdquo; </p>
<p >He rolled his eyes and took a bite out of the candy bar. &ldquo;Why fhe hewl wood &lsquo;ou wanna do &lsquo;at, Petey?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I flinched at the flecks of candy bar that nearly hit the table. &ldquo;Um&hellip; why would I want to do that? To find out <em>why</em> Gary did what he did. Why would he think any of this was a good idea? It just&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. He must&rsquo;ve known it couldn&rsquo;t last,&rdquo; I sighed again, frowning back down at the floor. &ldquo;&hellip;I guess I just want to know if I could&rsquo;ve done anything different to help.&rdquo; </p>
<p >We sat in silence processing those words for a few seconds before Jimmy thumped me cordially on the back. I let out what could only be described as a startled squeak, and was grateful he didn&rsquo;t comment. &ldquo;Sorry, Petey. Forget my own strength, sometimes.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;&lsquo;sokay. Thanks for trying to make me feel better, anyway,&rdquo; I yawned and glanced at my watch. &ldquo;Dang, it&rsquo;s getting late&mdash;I still gotta pack up for tomorrow,&rdquo; I stood up as Jimmy yawned. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m gonna head to bed.&rdquo; </p>
<p >He stood up and stretched as well. &ldquo;Yeah I gotta get some shut-eye too&mdash;&rdquo;as we moved to the hallway, he asked &ldquo;You still got my number?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I grinned and nodded. &ldquo;Yep! You&rsquo;ve got my address, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He nodded back. &ldquo;Yeah. Hey, in case I don&rsquo;t see you tomorrow, have a great summer,&rdquo; Then his face softened to look less angry than it normally does, and I was pretty sure he was trying to smile. I appreciated the effort. </p>
<p >&ldquo;You too, man. See ya!&rdquo; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >I shut the door as quietly as I could, not wanting to wake anybody. I let out a breath, and wandered over to my wardrobe to start changing into my PJs. In the meantime, I studied all the stuff I had accumulated over the last&hellip; gosh, had it really only been eight months? Felt like forever. It wasn&rsquo;t as much as what Jimmy had managed to amass in his room, but I had a few things&mdash;some Grottos and Gremlins cards I had found lying around, some of the drawings I&rsquo;m particularly proud of, other knick-knacks. It wasn&rsquo;t home of course, but it felt lived-in. Hell, I was almost sad to have to leave. Emphasis on <em>almost</em>. </p>
<p >Pulling on my pajamas, I found myself examining Gary&rsquo;s side of the room. He had almost always been sitting at his desk whenever I happened to be here these last few months, but I had tried to get out a little more&mdash;partly trying to avoid Gary, partly trying to get Jimmy to stop messing around and listen to me. So I wasn&rsquo;t sure just how much time he had spent here. Judging by the yelling match on the roof today, it had been a <em>lot</em>. </p>
<p >Examining Gary&rsquo;s stuff without him there actually made me realize how...generic it was. It reminded me of one of those showrooms in IKEA. I couldn&rsquo;t even say for sure if <em>anything</em> about his side of the room was different from the start of the year. Did he really just sit in his room this whole time? I shook my head, sighing. Oh well&hellip; I guess there&rsquo;s nothing that I can do about it now. Maybe Gary really will get better at Happy Volts&hellip; </p>
<p >I really don&rsquo;t believe that. I&rsquo;ve seen the way they treat children in this town, and I doubt they&rsquo;d treat the mentally compromised all that much better. Still&hellip;can&rsquo;t dwell on the past. I finally got into bed, turning the lamp off with a snap. Nothing you can do about it, Petey. </p>
<p >I finally fell asleep at two in the morning on Saturday, June 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2007. It&rsquo;d been a <em>very</em> long year. </p>
<p  >~~~Loop Two: Slingshot~~~ </p>
<p >I was awakened the next day by a gentle dive-bomb to my vital organs. &ldquo;OOF JESUS&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t really register the cackling that accompanied my rude wake-up call in between the groaning and curling up on myself. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Rise and shine, Femme Boy!&rdquo; <em>Wait&hellip;</em> I forced my eyes open at that familiar nick-name. &ldquo;Time for another fun-filled week of the highest-quality education available to donkeys anywhere!&rdquo; <em>&hellip;What?</em> </p>
<p >Gary finally got off of me, berating me as usual. &ldquo;Come <em>on</em>, Petey, you can always get back to your stupid, girly fantasies later, mmkay?&rdquo; As my brain struggled to catch up to what was going on, he turned away, walking over to his wardrobe. &ldquo;You know, Petey,&rdquo; What &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a good feeling about today.&rdquo; Whaaaaat &ldquo;You know that new kid we were discussing? Hopkins?&rdquo; He finally glanced back at me, and my mouth had probably been hanging open like a fish for the last thirty seconds. He raised one eyebrow as he pulled his arms through his shirt. &ldquo;&hellip;come on, Petey, I know you&rsquo;re madly in love with me but really&mdash;it&rsquo;s not polite to stare.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. How did he even get back in the building? &ldquo;What&hellip; but&hellip; you&hellip; wha-what&rsquo;re you doing here?&rdquo; He frowned in annoyance as he dipped his head to button his shirt up. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Geez, Petey, I <em>live</em> here, keep up,&rdquo; He began grumbling in frustration as he messed with his shirt, giving me just enough time to try and pick up the pieces of my brain that were scattered across the floor before he finished and added, &ldquo;Now, as I was saying, Hopkins is rumored to arrive today. Pretty exciting stuff, no?&rdquo; Finally finished, he shot me a lop-sided grin while he reached out to grab his vest. </p>
<p >My mind was still occupied with what-the-fuckery, leaving my mouth little to work with in the way of intelligent conversation. &ldquo;&hellip;um.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary full-on glared at me as his head popped through his vest. &ldquo;Jesus Petey, what&rsquo;s with you? You sound even more annoyingly girly than usual,&rdquo; Suddenly his face lit up and he grinned evilly. &ldquo;Oh, did poor, innocent Femme Boy have a bad dream?&rdquo; Straightening up from packing up his books, he started walking over to me, grinning wider all the time. &ldquo;Want me to <em>hold</em> you, hm? Aw, or kiss you and make it <em>better</em>?&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >I had no idea what was going on, but I was having none of this teasing bullshit. &ldquo;Gary, what are you <em>doing</em> here? Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be in&hellip; you know, Happy Volts?&rdquo; His grin evaporated immediately. </p>
<p >All cold anger, he hissed, &ldquo;What the <em>fuck</em>&rsquo;re you talking about, Kowalski?&rdquo; I was clearly treading in dangerous waters, but I needed to know what was going on! </p>
<p >&ldquo;Y-you and Jimmy fought yesterday?&rdquo; I decided to skootch to the end of the bed, just to be on the safe side. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Now Gary just looked&hellip; confused. That was weird. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; He seemed to suddenly realize something, but the confusion only deepened, narrowing his eyes at me in suspicion. &ldquo;You mean the new kid?&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Well, I guess?&hellip; I mean, he&rsquo;s been here nearly eight months, he&rsquo;s not exactly &lsquo;the new kid&rsquo; anymore&hellip;&rdquo; Gary seemed to be trying to ascertain whether I was bullshitting him or not. <em>What is going on!?</em> </p>
<p >Finally, he replied &ldquo;&hellip;No. I don&rsquo;t remember that. Hopkins hasn&rsquo;t even started attending this school yet, Petey, as I literally <em>just</em> mentioned,&rdquo; He shook his head, deciding that I must be the loony one, and turned back to packing up his stuff. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell if you need some of my meds, or if you need to stop taking them, Petey.&rdquo; Apparently he&rsquo;d finished, because he straightened up and started heading for the door. &ldquo;Welp, I&rsquo;m gonna head out. Try and not hallucinate anymore imaginary boyfriends, m&rsquo;kay?&rdquo; Gary waved merrily to me as he strolled out the door, shutting it behind him. </p>
<p >The normal waking-up noises of the boy&rsquo;s dormitory were all around me, and it sounded like any other day at Bullworth Academy. The familiar hum of misery and noise only amplified the confusing thoughts in my head. <em>Why the hell did Gary come back? </em>Was he suffering from some kind of amnesia? Had he somehow become so deluded that he forgot about yesterday?<em> Am </em>I<em> crazy?</em> </p>
<p >I shook my head for a moment, trying to stop the despair-spiral of thoughts I could feel coming. Take three deep breaths, then think logically about what you need to do. &hellip;in&hellip;out. &hellip;in&hellip;out. &hellip;in&hellip;out. Phew. Okay. Gary being back&hellip; was big news. Somebody in a position of authority needed to know. But there weren&rsquo;t any adults in the dorms. I guess the closest thing to &lsquo;authority&rsquo; in the dorms is Jimmy. Not the ideal person, but Jimmy would have to find out eventually. </p>
<p >As I got up to throw some clothes on, I just hoped beyond hope that Jimmy wouldn&rsquo;t be too harsh. He was obviously completely deluded, or in denial, or <em>something</em>. Happy Volts must be <em>horrible</em> for him to be fooling himself this much.... I decided not to think about it too hard. </p>
<p >As usual, Jimmy&rsquo;s door was wide open. I don&rsquo;t get why he likes having the door open, but hey, it&rsquo;s his room. I knocked a couple times for politeness&rsquo;s sake, but this situation was a little pressing. &ldquo;Uh, hey Jimmy?&rdquo; his head snapped up, and he started glaring at me. Must&rsquo;ve had a bad night&rsquo;s sleep. &ldquo;Sorry, it&rsquo;s just that&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;d <em>you</em> want?&rdquo; I flinched at the clear hostility in that question. That&rsquo;s odd, Jimmy isn&rsquo;t always <em>nice</em> to me, but he&rsquo;s never threatening&hellip; </p>
<p >I shuffled tentatively into the room. Which, come to think of it, looked kind of&hellip; empty? &ldquo;Hey, what happened to your stuff?&rdquo; Usually his room is crammed full of trophies and nick-knacks, along with general junk lying on the floor. </p>
<p >&ldquo;What? Hey, I asked you a fucking <em>question</em>, kid! What the hell do you <em>want</em>?&rdquo; He suddenly stood up from the bed and moved over to me like he was freakin&rsquo; <em>challenging</em> me! <em>What the heck!?</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;I-I was just&mdash;&rdquo; why was Jimmy so mad at me? </p>
<p >&ldquo;Ooh my, isn&rsquo;t the new kid <em>scary!</em>&rdquo; And now Gary was here, and it was probably going to get violent, fast. I backed as far away from the pair as I could get. <em>Here we go</em>. &ldquo;Come on, pal, give up the tough-guy act.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy frowned, glaring at Gary who, unsurprisingly, was sporting a wide grin. &ldquo;Hey man, what&rsquo;s your problem?&rdquo; I frowned. What was he <em>doing</em>? He&rsquo;d just spent yesterday telling <em>Gary</em> what his problem was. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Well, ADD primarily&hellip;&rdquo; Gary started wandering over to where I was, and I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what to do. If they weren&rsquo;t going to fight, I figured I didn&rsquo;t really have anything to worry about. But hadn&rsquo;t we had this conversation before? &ldquo;&hellip;But really, honestly, enough about me&mdash;Ah, I see you&rsquo;ve met the dorm&rsquo;s mascot!&rdquo; Gary flung his arm around my shoulder, and I <em>knew</em> this had happened before. &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Femme Boy! The&mdash;&rdquo; <em>This was the </em>exact<em> thing Gary said and did!</em> &ldquo;&mdash;<strong>girliest</strong> boy in school,&rdquo; I ducked out of Gary's arm before lightly shoving him away. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Uhhh look, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on guys, but&mdash;&rdquo; I backed away, looking from Jimmy to Gary and back, &ldquo;Ahaha, this is getting a liiiittle creepy,&rdquo; Jimmy just looked angry and confused (which was his norm, to be honest) but Gary was scrutinizing me and it was kinda creeping me out. </p>
<p >&ldquo;&hellip;Come now, Petey, don&rsquo;t call the new kid creepy!&rdquo; Gary looked Jimmy up and down as if examining him, mock-picking up his hand and inspecting it before he shrugged. &ldquo;Sure, he looks like he&rsquo;s on a one-way track to prison&hellip;&rdquo; He ignored Jimmy&rsquo;s angry glare as he snatched his hand back, instead crossing his arms and shaking his head at me&mdash;as if he was disappointed in me. &ldquo;&hellip;but you really shouldn&rsquo;t make snap judgements like that.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy looked pretty pissed, interrupting with, &ldquo;Hey, I gotta unpack. Why don&rsquo;t you two fuckwads beat it, huh?&rdquo; <em>He didn&rsquo;t say it like that last time&hellip; Did he?</em> </p>
<p >Gary grinned as he started for the door, me on his heels. &ldquo;Haha, now look what you&rsquo;ve done Pete! Jimmy hates you <em>already</em>.&rdquo; <em>Does he?</em> I looked at Jimmy&mdash;he did look pretty mad. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m, uh, sorry if I offended you Jimmy, I d-didn&rsquo;t mean t-to&hellip;&rdquo; Wrong thing to say, apparently. Jimmy looked ready to punch my lights out. </p>
<p >&ldquo;<strong>Stop</strong> calling me Jimmy!&rdquo; He accentuated his point by slamming his hands on either side of my head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even fuckin&rsquo; <em>know</em> you, kid. Where the hell did you learn my name!?&rdquo; Jimmy was clearly prepared to <em>beat</em> me should I try and get away. I had forgotten that my friend could be utterly terrifying when he wanted to. </p>
<p >&ldquo;IdontreallyknowwhatsgoingonImsosorrypleasedontkillme&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Whoa, whoa, ladies, break it up!&rdquo; Gary lightly pushed Jimmy away from the wall, getting him to refocus his attention, and I tried to calm myself down. My only friend looking like he was about to <em>kill</em> me was not something I would be forgetting anytime soon. &ldquo;Really, James, your name has been on quite a few people&rsquo;s lips lately.&rdquo; I looked between the two of them. This was the beginning of the school year&hellip; </p>
<p >Jimmy continued to look angry. &ldquo;Yeah? Like who?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary just shrugged in a non-committal manner. &ldquo;Oh, everybody. People loooove to talk in this town, Jimmy-boy.&rdquo; Did&hellip; did I go back in time? A sudden yank on my forearm broke my train of thought, and nearly sent me face-planting on the floor. &ldquo;Anyhow, we&rsquo;ll get out of your way, <em>James</em>. See you at school in a few!&rdquo; Then, I was basically dragged down the hallway and flung against one of the walls separating the common room from the rest of the hall. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Jesus, Kowalski. It&rsquo;s almost amazing how pathetic you are,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t see Gary&rsquo;s expression, but his voice sounded absolutely disgusted. He crossed his arms and leaned against the wall next to where I had collapsed, waiting for me to get up. &ldquo;I mean, seriously, Hopkins didn&rsquo;t even <em>do</em> anything to you and you&rsquo;re crying like a fucking faucet.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> What? </em>  I felt my face, and sure enough, it was pretty wet. &ldquo;&hellip;Oh..&rdquo; No wonder I couldn&rsquo;t catch my breath very well. I turned to sit against the wall, trying to deep breathe. &hellip;in&hellip;out. &hellip;in&hellip;out. &hellip;i&mdash;my mantra was interrupted by very loud laughter. </p>
<p >&ldquo;AHAHAHA Oh my God, you didn&rsquo;t even realize you were crying like a little girl?&rdquo; I looked up, and Gary was grinning and staring at me as if he&rsquo;d won the lottery. </p>
<p >Now I felt embarrassed. But what could I even say? I just tried to ignore Gary, but of course he took my silence as confirmation. He immediately doubled-over laughing. &ldquo;Ohahaha that is&hellip; oh man, that&rsquo;s priceless! Ehehehe&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Haha, are you fucking crying, pink-shirt kid?&rdquo; I sighed. Great, just what I needed, <em>another</em> person to bully me. That orange-haired Bully was grinning down at my, apparently, tear-streaked face. Turning, he yelled &ldquo;Oi, Wade, check out this <em>loser!</em>&rdquo; <em>You have got to be </em>kidding<em> me!</em> </p>
<p >I scrambled to my feet and made a beeline for my room. I heard a &ldquo;&mdash;Femme Boy&hellip;&rdquo; from behind, but I needed a few minutes to myself to think about what the heck was going on. <em>Maybe a few </em>years&hellip; </p>
<p >After shutting the door to my room so I could tear through all my binders and filing-cabinets, I had found: almost none of the work I&rsquo;d done throughout the year, <em>any</em> of the drawings I&rsquo;d made, trading cards I&rsquo;d found or nick-knacks I&rsquo;d received throughout the year, and I&rsquo;d even looked at my watch, which said the date was September 9<sup>th</sup>. With all this evidence, I had come to the conclusion that I had gone back in time. &hellip;somehow. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> I must be crazy&hellip; I  </em> have<em> to be crazy, ri&mdash;no. No, Pete, just&hellip; just go to class. Think about something else for a while, then tackle this later.</em> I shook my head, and&mdash;stuffing some of my books into my backpack&mdash;went out the door. </p>
<p >A couple seconds later, I re-entered the room, realizing that if I <em>had</em> gone back in time, I&rsquo;d need my first-semester class books, not the second-semester classes. <em>This is going to be weird.</em> </p>
<p >I held the Boy&rsquo;s dorm door for a couple of people (nobody said &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;) before I was able to walk into the brisk, autumn air myself. As I weaved between students screaming, crying, yelling, and/or being generally threatening, I stewed on how it was amazing to think that just a day ago all these kids had been fighting each other like wild animals. </p>
<p >Well, I guess they&hellip; didn&rsquo;t do that. They<em> will</em> be fighting each other? Whatever, focus&mdash;if I assume that I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> hallucinate an entire school year, what does this even mean? The din of the school lobby gave me plenty of white-noise in which to think clearly. Does this mean that somebody sent me back in time to try and change how the school year turns out? That made some kind of logical sense, even if I had no idea who would be able to send somebody <em>through time</em>, I could certainly think of plenty of people with the motivation to do so. The school year had been a pretty shitty one for lots of people. </p>
<p >As I entered the cafeteria, Gary&rsquo;s voice reached my ears. Turning around, I saw Gary and Jimmy talking. Or, well, Gary talking, and Jimmy providing occasional comments. &ldquo;&hellip;and condescending attitudes!&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Yeah, massively inbred and completely brainless,&rdquo; I noticed Gary smile approvingly as I walked over automatically, still lost in my own thoughts. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Very observant, Jimmy-boy. Now over there&ndash; oh, hell-OH Femme Boy!&rdquo; I sighed to myself. <em>Honestly, Pete, what did you even come over for&mdash;to ask for advice on time travel?</em> &ldquo;You finally finish <em>crying</em> to your <em>mommy?</em>&rdquo; Gary emphasized his words by punching me twice, and even though I&rsquo;d kind of been expecting it, I still managed to flinch horribly. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Ow! Oof! Yeah, yeah, I&rsquo;m done crying.&rdquo; I rubbed the arm that Gary had punched. <em>That&rsquo;s definitely going to bruise</em>. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Gary turn to Jimmy, who was looking&hellip;a little awkward, actually. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Can you believe this little <em>girl</em>&rdquo; Gary reached out to pinch my cheek like some sadistic grandmother, ignoring my squeak of pain to continue his tale. &ldquo;&hellip;was <em>crying</em> about you not liking him?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy glared Gary in the eye for a bit before looking at me as I stopped rubbing my arm, trying to not seem like too big a wimp. He seemed to reach a conclusion because he replied &ldquo;Yeah, actually.&rdquo; He, shrugged, adding &ldquo;I can believe that.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I shuffled my feet, and figured I might as well try and apologize to him&mdash;I wanted to keep being friends with him, after all. <em>Even if that was just a hallucination</em>. &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m sorry about freaking you out back there&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about how weird it would sound that I knew your name.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy shrugged, breaking eye-contact with me to stare at his feet and kick some imaginary dust off to the side. &ldquo;&lsquo;scool. Look, I&rsquo;m&hellip; sorry for&hellip; you know.&rdquo; He looked back up at me. &ldquo;We cool?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I smiled. <em>Maybe this won&rsquo;t be so bad!</em> &ldquo;Yeah, it- OOF&rdquo; <em>Oh that&rsquo;s right, I forgot about Gary.</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;Aww isn&rsquo;t this cute. In fact, I think I might be tearing up.&rdquo; Gary gave a huge sniff as if he were crying. And it had been going so well. BRRRRRING! Gary stopped mock-crying, looking up at the bell in annoyance. &ldquo;&hellip;I suppose we&rsquo;ll need to continue this heart-to-heart later,&rdquo; He finally unhooked his arm from around my neck, and, waving good-by to Jimmy and blowing an imaginary kiss to me, he disappeared into the departing throng of students. &hellip;<em>oh crap!</em> In all the excitement, I had forgotten about class. Where was I supposed to be, again? </p>
<p >As students streamed past, I noticed that Jimmy actually looked as lost as I felt. <em>That&rsquo;s right, Jimmy probably doesn't even know where any of his classes are</em>. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your first class, Jimmy? I can show you where the room is, if you want.&rdquo; </p>
<p >He looked as relieved as somebody with chronic bitch-face can look. &ldquo;Yeah, all they told me was that my first class is Chemistry. Didn&rsquo;t even fuckin&rsquo; tell me where the room is.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;That&rsquo;s actually not very far from here,&rdquo; We followed the flow of students out the door of the cafeteria, as I started to get recollections from the &lsquo;previous&rsquo; year. &ldquo;You know, I think Chem is my first class, too.&rdquo; <em>I do remember being in Chem with Jimmy a couple times&hellip; He advanced pretty fast.</em> </p>
<p >Jimmy wasn&rsquo;t paying me much attention, looking instead to a Greaser spray-painting MONEY DON&rsquo;T BUY CLASS on the back of the stairs. &ldquo;Huh. Where&rsquo;d he get that spray-paint?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I raised an eyebrow as I adjusted a strap on my backpack, looking at Jimmy out the corner of my eye. <em>What does he mean?</em> &ldquo;Probably an art store?&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy snorted as the Greaser ran from a Prefect as they walked past. &ldquo;No age limit, huh?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> Huh?  </em> &ldquo;What do you mean? An age limit on&hellip; paint?&rdquo; I felt a little tug of sympathy at such a damper on artistic potential&mdash;when I was little my mom had loved laying down a giant piece of paper in the backyard so the two of us could throw paint around and see what it looked like. <em>That&rsquo;s kinda sad&hellip;</em> </p>
<p >I followed Jimmy into the room for Chemistry 1, leaving him to peer around at the room and wrinkle his nose at the horrible odor that permeated the space. &ldquo;Yeah, California makes you show ID to buy that kinda stuff. Like cigarettes and lottery tickets,&rdquo; <em>Wow, have Jimmy and I really never talked about where he was from?</em> </p>
<p >As the teacher yelled at the students for entering the classroom, I just tried to keep the conversation going. &ldquo;I, uh, didn&rsquo;t know that was a thing. Actually,&rdquo; as we talked I started organizing the chemicals I would need for the day as the teacher wrote them on the board, cocking my head as I thought, &ldquo;Now that I think about it, there <em>could</em> be a legal age here&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never tried to buy spray-paint.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy snorted and gave a small shrug as if to say <em>fair enough</em>. But the teacher then began to give them our instructions at top speed, forcing us to concentrate on our work. </p>
<p >Two and a half hours later, I finally sat down to eat lunch. Instead of eating it, though, I just stared at it. <em>I&rsquo;m really back at the start of the school year.</em> This had been bubbling at the back of my mind all through the morning&rsquo;s classes. I looked around at all the kids who were sitting with their friends, talking, laughing. Images of Townies cracking wooden bats over the heads of Greasers and Nerds cackling madly as a small throng of Jocks were thrown high in the air from an explosion flashed through my head. <em>They have no idea how crazy this year can get. None.</em> </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> Just like me last&hellip; year? Last time? Previously? </em>  I looked back down at my miserable-looking sandwich. <em>Last&hellip; try. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m being given a free life in a video game or something.</em> As I ate, the chewing at least giving me something to do, I thought. <em>I&rsquo;ll probably never find out why this happened&hellip; but does it really matter? The most important question is how to not waste this opportunity. What could I change that could make last year&rsquo;s&hellip; insanity not happen, or at least not hurt so many pe&mdash;</em> &ldquo;HEY FEMME BOY!&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;GAH&rdquo; I flinched from the sudden noise in my right ear. To the surprise of nobody, I could hear Gary Smith snickering at my reaction. In the ear that hadn&rsquo;t just been shouted at, that is. <em>Godamn, just when I was getting somewhere.</em> </p>
<p >Gary was still snickering as he sat down on my left side. &ldquo;Oh, Petey. You&rsquo;re <em>wayyy</em> too easy to scare.&rdquo; Picking up the other half of the sandwich, he gestured with it in my direction as if it were a pointer for a presentation. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so lost in whatever dumbass daydreams you have you don&rsquo;t even pay attention to anything else.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I sighed. &ldquo;Yeah, I guess.&rdquo; Remembering what I had been pondering, I added, &ldquo;It was pretty important though. So it&rsquo;s not like I was wasting my attention.&rdquo; Gary just shrugged, taking a big bite out of my sandwich in response. I rolled my eyes. <em>Well okay then.</em> Looking to the other half of my sandwich, I shrugged and picked it up.<em> Who knows if Gary&rsquo;s gonna take this one too.</em> </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >The next afternoon, I tried to get my plans for the day in order as the bell to end Math rang. I had a few minutes of free time now before my next class. As I packed my papers and books, I reflected on this.. second day of the &lsquo;second&rsquo; school year. I&rsquo;d been sticking to my regular schedule, at least as far as I could remember from the beginning of the year. Shouldering my bag, I quickly exited the room before the teacher could assign me some &lsquo;extra credit&rsquo; or something for being slow. </p>
<p >Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; I usually went back to the dorm earlier in the day than later in the year, I think&mdash;plus, I know Gary&rsquo;s going to try and recruit me for the takeover thing soon. Making my way down the main staircase, I tried not to panic about how I&rsquo;d already let myself be fooled once and had no real plan as to how to accomplish my goal. I&rsquo;d.. just have to try and convince him it&rsquo;s a bad idea. Easy enough, right? </p>
<p >First things first, though. There were still classes to attend, and my least favorite class was coming up&mdash;gym<em>.</em> As I walked down the stairs to the back of the building though, a wave of deja&rsquo;vu swept through me. <em>Whoa! What?</em> I looked around as I walked toward the fountain. <em>Everything looks normal, what was that about?</em> </p>
<p >Before I realized anything had happened, I was on the ground with papers flying everywhere. Ow&hellip; Somebody&rsquo;s cackling retreated into the distance as I tried to pick myself up. &ldquo;Shit Petey, didj&rsquo;ya see where that dick went?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy had run up, and he looked rather out of breath. Not to mention like he wanted to beat the crap out of somebody. <em>Oh&hellip; yeah&hellip; I remember this&hellip;</em> I turned to look at the fountain behind me. &ldquo;Y-yeah, he went that way. Don&rsquo;t worry, I got these pap&mdash;&rdquo; but Jimmy had already run off. &ldquo;&mdash;ers.&rdquo; </p>
<p >As I picked my stuff up, I shuddered as I recalled Jimmy&rsquo;s expression from just now. But more than that;<em> wasn&rsquo;t this&hellip; the day Gary first talked about his plan? Shoot&hellip; and I&rsquo;m not any closer to knowing what caused all that insanity in the first place.</em> Either way, as I rushed off to Gym I re-affirmed my desire to NEVER get on Jimmy&rsquo;s bad side. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em>As if I needed another reminder after yesterday&hellip; </em></p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >I dragged myself into the common room and collapsed onto the couch, intent on just sitting and watching some TV to relax after class. <em>Goddamn, Burton really worked us hard today. Man&mdash;guess it was good that Jimmy wasn&rsquo;t there; I would definitely be hurting more if he had been.</em> </p>
<p >But sadly, relaxation was not on somebody else&rsquo;s mind that evening. &ldquo;Good evening, young lady! And what&rsquo;re we watching today?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> Uuuuugh </em>  &ldquo;What do you want, Ga&mdash;&rdquo; I was immediately put on high alert, remembering my train of thought from earlier. <em>Oh shit, that&rsquo;s right&hellip; I just hope I&rsquo;m wrong&hellip;</em> </p>
<p >Gary answered my uncompleted sentence, unaware of my newly-heightened emotional distress. &ldquo;Oh, what everybody wants, Femme Boy. I&rsquo;m just better at getting it.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I blinked. <em>&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;&hellip;Right. I feel like I should find that a little creepy&hellip;&rdquo; I considered getting up to turn on the TV, but decided I was too tired, instead reaching for my bag to find something to do. Gary, meanwhile, frowned at my comment. </p>
<p >&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather rude, Petey. What&rsquo;re you trying to imply?&rdquo; I could feel Gary&rsquo;s eyes on me even though I wasn&rsquo;t looking at him. I tried not to shudder. <em>I&rsquo;m way too tired to deal with this&hellip;</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;Uh&hellip; nothing. Just forget it.&rdquo; Finally settling on dragging my sketchbook out, I pulled it into my lap and just started doodling. </p>
<p >But a grin was spreading across Gary&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Aw, butthurt about getting knocked around today, Femme Boy?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I looked up from the page of eye sketches I&rsquo;d started. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; I frowned. <em>Gary somehow knew about Jimmy not helping me up last time, too...</em> &ldquo;W-what do you mean?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Gary&rsquo;s grin spread even wider. &ldquo;Come on, Petey&mdash;don&rsquo;t lie to me. You look like shit.&rdquo; Leaning back, he swept his gaze up and down my form in a way that I found kind of disturbing. I leaned back while Gary&rsquo;s expression shifted to something bordering on sympathetic. &ldquo;Gym class isn&rsquo;t kind to those of us with more intellectual leanings, after all.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Oh! Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; I breathed a sigh. Turning back to my sketches, I continued, &ldquo;Burton really worked us hard today. Hope he&rsquo;s not as tough on Thursday&hellip;&rdquo; Frowning as I put pencil to paper, I muttered more to myself &ldquo;Plus, Jimmy&rsquo;ll be there, so that&rsquo;ll make it much tougher.&rdquo; A chill went through me as a picture of Jimmy&rsquo;s expression earlier that day mingled with all the times I&rsquo;d seen the horrible anger my friend could express. <em>He really can be terrifying sometimes.</em> </p>
<p >I could hear the smirk in Gary&rsquo;s next comment. &ldquo;Oh, you heard too, Petey?&rdquo; He got up from the couch, moving to turn on the TV. &ldquo;Jimmy-boy is making quite the name for himself, winning a slingshot off those Bullies like that.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I looked up at that. &ldquo;Huh? A slingshot?&rdquo; Gary hm&rsquo;d distractedly as he flipped through channels, trying to find something to watch. <em>Huh! The more you know, I guess</em>. <em>I&rsquo;d assumed he&rsquo;d always had that.</em> Resuming my sketching, I tried to enjoy being able to sketch in peace. Since it&rsquo;d been on my mind, I&rsquo;d ended up with some rough approximations of Jimmy&rsquo;s Murder face. I frowned, scanning the drawing critically. <em>Huh. Jimmy&rsquo;s kinda hard to draw now that I think about it.</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;Your new boyfriend, Femme Boy?&rdquo; Gary had, unbeknownst to me, sat back down and started leaning over so that he could see what I was drawing. I snapped the book closed, a response that made Gary laugh. </p>
<p >&ldquo;No! Ew, dude, don&rsquo;t be gross.&rdquo; <em>Besides, Zoe would </em>kill<em> me! Well, she will, I guess.</em> </p>
<p >Gary stopped laughing abruptly, and gave me a very level stare. &ldquo;But seriously. Pete.&rdquo; His serious expression was almost more frightening than the laughter. &ldquo;If you ever find yourself in an abusive relationship, you&rsquo;ll let me know right?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Sighing, I replied &ldquo;Whatever, man.&rdquo; Turning back to my sketch, I added, &ldquo;Would it kill you to just leave me alone for once?&rdquo; </p>
<p >At that, Gary grabbed my sketchbook and flung it onto the floor. Ignoring my protests, he advanced toward my side of the couch. &ldquo;Oh, but Femme Boy, don&rsquo;t tell me he&rsquo;s NOT abusive.&rdquo; His grin started to gain an uncomfortably familiar edge to it, and I scooched rapidly toward the other end of the couch, nearly forgetting about my sketchbook. </p>
<p >&ldquo;What? No, I just said&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Seriously, Petey? Who ignores another person lying on the ground and runs off without even helping them up?&rdquo; He gave me a look that could&rsquo;ve been sympathetic or patronizing. But I frowned. <em>He does have a point, but&hellip; didn&rsquo;t he say something similar last time?</em> </p>
<p >Gulping down my nerves, I replied slowly &ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what Jimmy was doing, so I can&rsquo;t assume he was being a jerk just because he didn&rsquo;t stop to help me up.&rdquo; <em>Maybe it was important, or something.</em> </p>
<p >Leaning back a little, he frowned, and then sighed, as if I was being extremely thick. Gesticulating with his hands, he leaned toward me again, but I fought the temptation to move away. &ldquo;Look Pete, it&rsquo;s really simple. Jimmy isn&rsquo;t a good person, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I frowned. I didn&rsquo;t want to bad-mouth my friend, but&hellip; my eyes focused on the sketchbook that Gary had thrown away, which had fallen on the page I&rsquo;d been working on just minutes ago. Even so, I hesitated a bit more before nodding in agreement. </p>
<p >Smirking, Gary added &ldquo;Not like <em>you</em>.&rdquo; his smirk deepened at my utter confusion, but he didn&rsquo;t address it. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s face it, Femme Boy, you&rsquo;re probably the <em>nicest</em> kid on campus.&rdquo; I leaned back as my confusion evaporated. I remembered <em>this</em> conversation all too well. I frowned, reflecting on &lsquo;last year&rsquo;; Gary&rsquo;d spun some yarn about how together I and he could &lsquo;remake the school in our image&rsquo;. I hadn&rsquo;t really wanted to say yes&hellip; but Gary hadn&rsquo;t given me time to even think, so I&rsquo;d agreed. Then, Jimmy&rsquo;d shown up, and Gary had spouted some bullshit philosophy about &lsquo;letting the losers drown&rsquo;. While staring directly at <em>me</em>. Then&hellip; well. The less said about &lsquo;what happens to liars&rsquo; the better in my opinion. He was too busy counting &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo;s&rsquo; traits off on his fingers to notice my reaction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen you hit somebody despite the fact that nearly everybody at this lousy school taunts you, you&rsquo;re constantly helping people pick up crap they&rsquo;ve dropped; you even apologize when somebody bumps into <em>you</em>.&rdquo; Gary shrugged, finally fixing his gaze directly on me, at which point his pleasant smile quickly disappeared to be replaced with confusion. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re practically a... hey, what&rsquo;s your problem?&rdquo; </p>
<p >&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;sorry. I&hellip; wasn&rsquo;t paying attention.&rdquo; Crossing my arms, I decided to go all-in. Looking him dead in the eye, I said &ldquo;Look, Gary, just tell me what you want.&rdquo; </p>
<p >His confusion seemed to melt away to reveal anger. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what he was so mad for. In a dangerously soft voice he asked &ldquo;Whatever do you mean, Femme Boy?&rdquo; He then shook his head, as if snapping himself out of something before giving me a concerned frown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to help the people at this school be better friends! Don&rsquo;t you want that, Petey?&rdquo; He leaned over and laid a hand on my shoulder &ldquo;A school where people could befriend others instead of fighting them?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I was afraid to meet his gaze&mdash;would his disingenuous intentions shine through? Or would they stay hidden? I wasn&rsquo;t sure which option scared me more. &ldquo;&hellip;Yeah&hellip; but...&rdquo; I sighed, deciding I couldn&rsquo;t forsake Jimmy. &ldquo;I have to support my friends, too.&rdquo; </p>
<p >To my surprise, Gary clapped his hands together in delight. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfect! Oh, man&mdash;with my strategy, Jimmy&rsquo;s muscle, and your morals, we can do practically anything we want!&rdquo; I turned back to Gary, who was no longer paying me any attention&mdash;he had that crazed look that I remembered so well from &lsquo;last year&rsquo; as he rubbed his hands together. &ldquo;Hehe, boy oh boy this is so <em>exciting!</em>&rdquo; <em>That wasn&rsquo;t what I meant!</em> </p>
<p >I shook my head, really backing away from him now. &ldquo;What? No! I don&rsquo;t wanna be part of your stupid plan.&rdquo; He froze to give me a blank look. <em>Oh shit.</em> </p>
<p >Luckily, he didn&rsquo;t sound angry when he said quietly &ldquo;But Petey, didn&rsquo;t you just say you wanted to support your friends?&rdquo; Gary quirked an eyebrow up at me, as if I were missing something very basic. </p>
<p >I furrowed my eyebrows in confusion. &ldquo;Yeah? So?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He laughed a little and rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Come on, Femme Boy, do I not count? I&rsquo;m literally the <em>only</em> person who talks to you.&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s expression seemed to be a mix of pride, pity, and amusement. </p>
<p >At that moment, something in me SNAPED and I decided; <strong>fuck</strong> <strong>this</strong>. I stared him straight in the eye, and found myself answering in a mocking tone &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <em>lie</em>, Gary. Don&rsquo;t you know what <em>happens</em> to liars?&rdquo; As I stood up to get my sketchbook, i heard somebody else walk in, but I wasn&rsquo;t really paying attention. </p>
<p >&ldquo;&hellip;do you want to run that by me again, Kowalski?&rdquo; As I swung my backpack onto my shoulder, Gary rose from his seat and loomed dangerously over me, and I shrank back a little. <em>Crap I forgot that Gary can still kick my ass&hellip;</em> </p>
<p >Then, I heard Jimmy ask &ldquo;Hey, the fuck&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Gary snapped his head in his direction, and smoothly threw an arm around my shoulder in a cordial manner. <em>Hey!</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;Hey, man&mdash;nothin&rsquo; to worry about.&rdquo; From his voice alone, I could tell Gary was grinning. <em>Are you serious!?</em> &ldquo;Petey&rsquo;s just getting a little too big for his britches, isn&rsquo;t that right, Femme Boy?&rdquo; And God as my witness, Gary patted me on the head like a little kid. <em>That&rsquo;s it&mdash;FUCK this!</em> I shoved him off me and blindly stormed out of the common room. I bumped into somebody on the way out but was too lost in my own anger to give a shit. Gary shouted after me: &ldquo;Aw, don&rsquo;t be like that Petey! You know I still love you, come on!&rdquo; </p>
<p >Turning around as I backed out of the dorm, I flipped him the bird, shouting: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a plan for you: Go fuck yourself, Gary!&rdquo; Before shoving the door open and letting it shut with a satisfying BANG. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >The sun looked like it was setting outside, but the shadow of the main building blocked most of the light from entering the inside of the library. The only sounds were the scratching of pens, turning of pages, and occasional light coughs from busy students. I, on the other hand, was trying my best to stop myself from repeatedly slamming my head on the table. I settled for trying to smother myself with my hands. </p>
<p >I was going to have to apologize. Gary hadn&rsquo;t done anything wrong&mdash;at least, nothing that he remembered. And it was hardly fair to hold something against him that he didn&rsquo;t even remember doing. But I really couldn&rsquo;t feel sorry for it; it&rsquo;d been soooo satisfying.<em> I&rsquo;m surprised he didn&rsquo;t come beat the shit out of me immediately, actually. I doubt it would&rsquo;ve have taken that great a logical leap to figure out that I&rsquo;d gone to the library&hellip;</em> </p>
<p >I shook my head, refocusing on the matter at hand. I still needed to find out what the hell happened &lsquo;last year&rsquo;. Or was going to happen, anyway. And it was pretty obvious that Gary had played a big role in what&rsquo;d gone down&mdash;so why had he done it? I still had no idea. And I probably wasn&rsquo;t going to find out if he would rather kick me in the nuts than talk to me. </p>
<p >Groaning in despair, I crossed my arms and hid my head in the little pocket of air. <em>I was going to have to swallow my pride big time&hellip;</em> I heard the chair across the way scrap as somebody sat down, so I chanced a peek from my arm-cage. </p>
<p >Jimmy was sitting across from me, looking supremely uncomfortable. My startled &ldquo;Jimmy?&rdquo; caused a chorus of &lsquo;SHUSH&rsquo;es to emanate from all directions. </p>
<p >I was about to apologize but he cupped his hand around his mouth and practically shouted &ldquo;Hey, shut up! I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to talk to my friend here!&rdquo; I grimaced and darted my eyes around the space looking for any authority figures. </p>
<p >Whispering hastily, I tried to do some damage control. &ldquo;No, no Jimmy, it&rsquo;s fine, we can talk somewhere else,&rdquo; The hostility in his face melted away, and he nodded. After leaving the library (and apologizing to a disappointed-looking librarian), I resumed our conversation as we parked ourselves in the courtyard of the library, away from the Nerds hanging around. &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy shrugged. &ldquo;You looked super pissed off earlier. Figured ya needed some time to calm down,&rdquo; As he talked, Jimmy pulled his slingshot out of his pocket and started taking potshots at people passing by from far away. He didn&rsquo;t manage to hit anybody, but he seemed to enjoy it. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Yeah, actually&mdash;I did need some time to cool down. Thanks..&rdquo; I frowned. It made sense at the end of &lsquo;last year&rsquo; that Jimmy would be so friendly toward me, since &lsquo;the king&rsquo; felt bad about ignoring me for all that time. But I wasn&rsquo;t sure why this Jimmy was being so nice. &ldquo;Hey, um. This may sound like a weird question&hellip;&rdquo; He nodded to show he was listening as he pulled back the slingshot for another round. &ldquo;But why are you being so&hellip; nice to me?&rdquo; </p>
<p >At that, he turned toward me and dropped his firing arm. &ldquo;Wha&rsquo;dya mean? You seem like a nice kid&mdash; why wouldn&rsquo;t I be nice to ya?&rdquo; I shrugged and looked out across the library courtyard, pointedly not saying &lsquo;Well you weren&rsquo;t this nice <em>last</em> time.&rsquo; There was a long stretch of silence before Jimmy sighed, and stuffed his hands into his pockets. &ldquo;Look, kid, you wanna talk about what went down between you and Gary? I don&rsquo;t really know either of you but that looked like some serious shit.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I shifted awkwardly. I was already pretty uncomfortable with this topic of conversation&mdash;talking about it with <em>Jimmy</em> of all people wasn&rsquo;t helping my nerves. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really wanna talk about it. It&rsquo;s just&hellip; really complicated,&rdquo; Thinking again about how Gary had been talking down to me earlier made me let out an angry huff. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, Gary&rsquo;s such a dick, you know?&rdquo; Jimmy nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Yeah, he&rsquo;s so&hellip; so&hellip; <em>superior</em>, it&rsquo;s really annoying. He just thinks he&rsquo;s <em>sooo</em> much better than everybody else.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy laughed a little, adding, &ldquo;Ha, yeah&mdash;like every time he gives a compliment it&rsquo;s like &lsquo;holy shit you can <em>tie</em> your <em>shoes</em> I never would&rsquo;ve guessed you could do that&rsquo;!&rdquo; </p>
<p >I snickered, &ldquo;Haha, yeah, or he&rsquo;s trying to get you to do something, and you don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s lying or not.&rdquo; I shook my head. Like how he was acting like we were friends. Yeah right&mdash; &lsquo;last year&rsquo; Jimmy was right; we were <em>never</em> friends. </p>
<p >Jimmy snorted. &ldquo;Yeah, hard to tell with that guy,&rdquo; He leaned against the wall separating the library from the rest of campus, surveying the passing students as he pulled out his slingshot again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, today he actually helped me figure this thing out,&rdquo; He pulled back, actually managing to shoot somebody rather far away, I guess to demonstrate this new skill. &ldquo;But he insulted me the whole fuckin&rsquo; time, and then just ditched me after I did what he wanted.&rdquo; Frowning, he added, &ldquo;That Algernon kid I helped earlier said he was a sociopath&mdash;that&rsquo;s the thing where somebody doesn&rsquo;t have feelings, right?&rdquo; He looked at me, seemingly for confirmation. </p>
<p >I shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know. I think it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated than just not being able to feel emotions, though.&rdquo; Dropping my backpack, I propped myself on the wall as Jimmy resumed attempting to hit people with the slingshot. &ldquo;Besides, Gary definitely feels emotions, he just&hellip;&rdquo; I thought about Gary from &lsquo;last year&rsquo;, as he sunk deeper and deeper into his plans to ruin Jimmy, ignoring me (which I knew shouldn&rsquo;t bother me as much as it did), and generally preparing to fuck the whole school over. But <em>why</em>? &ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ve got no clue <em>what</em> Gary&rsquo;s deal is.&rdquo; <em>I mean, it&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s </em>something<em> wrong with him, but&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got no idea what it could be</em>. </p>
<p >Missing somebody else, Jimmy let out a disappointed raspberry before adding &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s got something to do with all that medication he keeps bitching about.&rdquo; I perked up at that. <em>Medication? I think Gary's mentioned that before.</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;I assumed it was some kind of physical thing; my parents always said it&rsquo;s impolite to ask.&rdquo; I shrugged, watching the arc of another shot from the slingshot miss its target. &ldquo;My dad takes a lot of vitamins, so didn&rsquo;t even really notice.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy snorted. &ldquo;Yeah right; practically the first thing he said to me was that his meds made him crazy&mdash;that if you act weird here, they force you to take &lsquo;em.&rdquo; He glanced sidelong at me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; not true, right?&rdquo; <em>He looks a little worried&hellip;</em> </p>
<p >I thought for a moment before shaking my head. &ldquo;If it is, I&rsquo;ve never heard about it, and I&rsquo;ve lived in this town all my life.&rdquo; Gaining confidence in the certainty of my knowledge, I nodded, continuing &ldquo;I think something like that would be pretty hard to keep under wraps, especially since my dad used to be a teacher before he became a librarian; he keeps tabs on that kinda stuff.&rdquo; At that, Jimmy looked a little relieved&mdash;or at least, his eyebrows stopped furrowing together so hard. I gave him a reassuring smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve got nothing to worry about.&rdquo; </p>
<p >A corner of Jimmy&rsquo;s mouth lifted up, making it look a bit like he was smirking. &ldquo;Yeah, like they&rsquo;d get me to take that stuff. That shit&rsquo;s <em>insane</em>.&rdquo; Jimmy moved his gaze elsewhere, looking for non-living targets to practice hitting as he continued speaking. &ldquo;I tried some once, and I couldn&rsquo;t sit still for four fucking hours.&rdquo; He shuddered. &ldquo;I ended up breaking into my school&rsquo;s cafeteria and stealing, like, fifty jars of peanut butter and covering my desk and locker with it.&rdquo; He snorted. &ldquo;Got expelled for <em>that</em> pretty fast.&rdquo; </p>
<p >We sat for a few minutes in silence as Jimmy tried to hit the windows of the third floor. Finally, I broke the silence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what? Peanut butter?&rdquo; <em>That makes literally </em>no<em> sense</em>. </p>
<p >Jimmy full-on grinned at that. &ldquo;HA! Yeah, I know. I was trying to mark my stuff. And since I like peanut butter, I figured that would make people realize that stuff was mine so they wouldn&rsquo;t mess with it.&rdquo; <em>Wha&hellip; </em>how<em> would that even help with a situation like that?</em> Jimmy looked at my confused face and nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, I know it makes no sense.&rdquo; He shrugged, adding &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;d have to hold me down now to get me to take that stuff&mdash;whatever&rsquo;s in those ADD meds, it&rsquo;s fuckin&rsquo; <em>insane</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo; A Greaser and a Prep started attacking each other in the distance, and both boys watched as some nearby prefects tackled both fighters to the ground. &ldquo;&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t know you liked peanut butter.&rdquo; <em>I really don&rsquo;t know much about Jimmy.</em> </p>
<p >Jimmy shrugged as he pulled back the slingshot again. &ldquo;Not so much now, I was pretty little back then.&rdquo; Taking aim at a Greaser trying to defend his friend from getting busted, he continued &ldquo;I only really like homemade peanut butter, so I don&rsquo;t eat it much.&rdquo; As his shot flew, we both flinched as it missed its mark&mdash;instead hitting the nearby prefect, who immediately zeroed in on Jimmy. &ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; Breaking into a run, he called over his shoulder to me &ldquo;Meet you back in the dorms, Pete!&rdquo; before disappearing around the corner with the prefect in hot pursuit. I smiled, surprised that Jimmy had actually called me &lsquo;Pete&rsquo; and not &lsquo;Petey&rsquo;&mdash;<em>looks like I have at least one friend around here.</em> </p>
<p  >~~~Loops Two Through Five: A Little Help~~~ </p>
<p >&ldquo;God, Femme Boy, who are you, my <em>shrink</em>? I&rsquo;ll take my meds when I fucking <em>want</em> to.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;You know Petey, the last time I checked my chemical health was none of your damn business.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Fuck off, Femme Boy, I&rsquo;m <em>busy</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;You&rsquo;re seriously starting to piss me off, Kowalski. So go find a lake to drown in, okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Pft, what!? Come <em>on</em> Petey, where the hell would you even get twenty bucks?&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t have a hundred bucks, Petey-weety? Well, looks like I can&rsquo;t take them today, then!&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;&hellip;Ahahahahaha! Hahahaha! Oh my <em>God</em> Femme Boy, are you seriously <em>threatening me</em>!? With <strong><em>what</em></strong>, exactly?! Hahahahaha~!&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;See, at first this was funny, Petey, but now it&rsquo;s just an annoying waste of my time. I have better shit to do than fend off white-shirted, acne&rsquo;d assholes&mdash;so don&rsquo;t make me turn them on you again, hm?&rdquo; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p>I took a deep breath to try and banish recollections of my two previous failures and steady my nerves; here goes nothing. &ldquo;Hey, Beatrice!&rdquo; The Nerd looked up from her book and frowned at me. She put her finger up to her lips in a clear &lsquo;shush&rsquo; gesture. Oh, right&mdash;library. I sat down and pulled out a notebook before scribbling a quick note.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Ink Free';" >Sorry about that. I just wanted to ask you about the tutoring flyer you have posted in the boy&rsquo;s dorms? </p>
<p>Her frown, to my disappointment, grew as she read the note. Not by much, but she seemed genuinely annoyed as she wrote a reply in red ink below.
    <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC'">That is not a question. If you mean &ldquo;Are you available for tutoring, Beatrice?&rdquo; then the answer is, I&rsquo;m afraid, no. I am already tutoring two other people, which is the maximum number my study schedule allows.</p>
<p>I frowned as I read her note. That&rsquo;s a little rude.... </p>
<p>I grabbed my own pen and began to compose my reply.
    <p style="font-family: 'Ink Free'">I know you&rsquo;re busy, but the other Nerds said I should talk to you if I want to learn about Neuroscience.</p>
<p>As Beatrice read over my note, her eyes widened in surprise, and she seemed to re-read the last sentence a couple of times before looking between me and the note. The surprise soon turned to skepticism.  </p>
<p>I noticed that her reply was written much faster than before.
    <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC'" >I&rsquo;m afraid that I can&rsquo;t take your request seriously until you prove to me that your intentions are genuine. Besides, I would still need time to arrange for alternate tutoring for my current students.</u>
<p>She pushed the note to me before turning her nose in the air. Christ, was she always going to be this condescending? </p>
<p>I guess Jimmy&rsquo;s jumped through more hoops for less.
    <p style="font-family: 'Ink Free'" >All right, what do I need to do to prove myself?</p>
<p>Hopefully, finally figuring out why the hell Gary&rsquo;s not taking his meds will be worth it. </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Bradley Hand ITC'"> Well, Mr. Burton took something&hellip; rather important to me today&hellip; </p>
<p>~~~ </p>
<p>Loop Three: &lt;um another mission title&gt; </p>
<p>It was my third time through, and I was trying to be inconspicuous in the empty hallway of the dorm. Halloween had been a couple of days ago, and Gary&rsquo;s violence had, as usual, spiked considerably. I shook off recollections of Bullies beating me up to laughter in the background. <em>At least I managed to not get kicked in the balls that time.</em> Small comforts, I reminded myself. Suddenly, I heard the door to the dorm slam open, and I picked my book back up, trying to look like I was engrossed. I could hear Gary muttering under his breath. &ldquo;&hellip;probably be back in a few minutes&hellip; regret treating me like this&hellip;&rdquo; I swallowed as he passed, almost entering the common room before he stopped. His head popped back out, looking at me suspiciously. &ldquo;&hellip;Femme Boy. Fancy seeing <em>you</em> here.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I gave the best smile I could, saying cordially &ldquo;Oh, hey Gary! How&rsquo;s it&hellip; uh&hellip; goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; his frown shifted to a smirk far too quickly for my liking. </p>
<p >He quickly walked over to me, grabbing my forearm and dragging me up as he said &ldquo;Simply <em>wonderful</em>, Petey! Haha, I feel <em>amazing</em>!&rdquo; I nodded politely as he dragged me over to the couch, glancing back with a crazed grin on his face. &ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve stopped taking those pills <em>ages</em> ago!&rdquo; I felt my shoulders sag a little even as I gave him a smile. Guess it didn&rsquo;t work; so much for all that research. I&rsquo;d thought I had convinced him he needed his meds&hellip; Gary&rsquo;s smile gained even more teeth when he looked at my expression as he shoved me down to sit on the couch. &ldquo;Now Petey, you don&rsquo;t need to lie to me!&rdquo; He tapped his head, leaning over me and saying quietly &ldquo;I know everything, remember?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I resisted the temptation to say &ldquo;uhhhhh&rdquo; like an idiot, and instead nodded, playing along. &ldquo;Right, sorry,&rdquo; At that, he sighed, whacking me on the back of the head as he began to pace in a rectangle around the couch. </p>
<p >&ldquo;God, Kowalski, you&rsquo;re so fucking pathetic. Can&rsquo;t you even <em>try</em> and defend yourself?&rdquo; After that he didn&rsquo;t say anything, returning to his frantic pacing and muttering. I took a deep breath, calming myself down. You&rsquo;ll see, Gary. </p>
<p >Of course, I knew what he was doing&mdash;waiting for Jimmy to get here. Which should be pretty soon&mdash;I&rsquo;d done this a couple of times, and the timing wasn&rsquo;t always consistent. But it seems like he&rsquo;s able to predict when Jimmy does something, so I figured I was safe following Gary&rsquo;s lead. Sure enough, a minute or so later the sound of the front door opening could be heard. I popped up from my seat, walking around the couch&mdash;I kept an eye on Gary, whose head had instantly snapped over to the door. Cautiously, I said &ldquo;Hey, Jimmy&ndash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >But Gary practically tripped over himself getting to Jimmy, saying in a frustrated tone &ldquo;THERE you are! Come on, I found something <em>incredible</em>!&rdquo; as he walked right past the other boy, as if expecting him to follow obediently. </p>
<p >But Jimmy, to my surprise, didn&rsquo;t follow. He held his hands up in a placating manner as I moved to stand next to Jimmy. <em>Lord knows nobody&rsquo;s going to pay me any attention.</em> &ldquo;Hold on, relax man. I can&rsquo;t keep getting in trouble; I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> get expelled again,&rdquo; I thought he sounded weirdly apologetic for such a reasonable argument against going to an illegal gambling scam with minors. </p>
<p >Gary whipped around and wasted no time getting in Jimmy&rsquo;s face&mdash;he snarled &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always about <strong>me</strong> with you!&rdquo; He began gesticulating wildly as he paced around, at which point I nudged Jimmy and gave a &lsquo;Gary, am I right?&rsquo; look. &ldquo;Me, <em>me, <strong>me!</strong></em>&rdquo; That got Jimmy to smile while Gary kept ranting, at least. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking <em>bigger picture</em>, and you two&rsquo;re worrying about getting into <strong>trouble</strong>!?&rdquo; Gary unmistakably glared at both ofus. &ldquo;You really <em>are</em> something.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy didn&rsquo;t seem too perplexed by all this, though. He crossed his arms, saying exasperatedly &ldquo;What &lsquo;bigger picture&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary&rsquo;s jaw had nearly dropped to the floor at Jimmy&rsquo;s &lsquo;stupidity&rsquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo; He groaned in frustration. &ldquo;uh&hellip;&rdquo; I had to hold in a snort at his terrible poker face. &ldquo;WE are gonna <em>take over</em> this school!&rdquo; </p>
<p >Before he&rsquo;d even finished his sentence, Jimmy began shaking his head, saying surprisingly calmly &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo; are not taking over <em>anything</em> right now,&rdquo; He even got rid of the usual casual slang he was so fond of. He then nudged me, shooting me a look asking me to back him up. </p>
<p >Either way, there wasn&rsquo;t any time to do so, since he quickly followed up with &ldquo;Time and tide wait for <em>no</em> man, my friend!&rdquo; Before lunging for Jimmy, taunting him with &ldquo;But it seems they <em>do</em> wait for a wanna-be tough guy who&rsquo;s <strong>nothing</strong> without his little <strong><em>girl</em></strong>!&rdquo; I frowned at that comment&mdash;he&rsquo;d fucking see. </p>
<p >Jimmy&rsquo;s fist definitely clenched at that, but he seemed to hold himself back, instead just snorting dismissively &ldquo;Man, you&rsquo;re full of it&rdquo; as he shouldered past Gary. </p>
<p >But Gary would not be so easily dissuaded. He actually seemed more cheerful now, even making a slight joke in the form of &ldquo;So you keep telling me&rdquo; before continuing &ldquo;Look&hellip; now come on, I promise you, after this?&rdquo; his manic grin returned as he said &ldquo;Things are <em>never</em> gonna be the same again!&rdquo; before turning away, his pacing getting more frantic. Tell me about it; things were coming to a head, fast. As he strode out the building, he shouted back toward them &ldquo;Come on, losers; adventure awaits!&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy just rolled his eyes, strolling after Gary casually. &ldquo;Whatever you say, Gary,&rdquo; He snorted in a small laugh, before looking over his shoulder at me. &ldquo;You comin&rsquo;? Still dunno what it is, but&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >I nodded, moving to the wall I&rsquo;d been sitting by earlier and grabbing my backpack and the baseball bat I&rsquo;d procured earlier. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; Jogging up to meet Jimmy at the doors of the dorm, he looked at my equipment in surprise. </p>
<p >&ldquo;What, you know where we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; I nodded, trying to keep the fear out of my expression. I knew what I had to do, and I knew Jimmy would physically be able to win, it just came down to <em>doing</em> it. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Gary found some&hellip; fighting ring in the basement of the school,&rdquo; Jimmy&rsquo;s expression lit up, and he grinned as we walked together. To keep my panic bottled up, I spent the small walk to the random Bully ambush explaining how the betting system worked. I had gotten better at dodging attacks over the last few loops, but I was still a shit fighter. The bat helped, but by the end of the confrontation it only had a good three, maybe four swings left. </p>
<p >Gary spent the entire &lsquo;obstacle course&rsquo; alternating between issuing orders to Jimmy and seemingly talking about whatever thought entered his head&mdash;about the poor maintenance of the school, the stupidity of the janitor, and how dumb of the school it was to keep pumpkins in storage; everything but any hint of what I knew was coming. As we walked down the corridor, I shook my head, berating myself. <em>Come on, Pete, first things first; beat Russell, then handle Gary.</em> To my surprise, Gary didn&rsquo;t start talking as soon as Jimmy was in front of him, instead raising an eyebrow expectantly at me. After he started up, though, the speech was pretty much exactly like the last two. Except instead of &lsquo;separates the men from the boys&rsquo; he said &lsquo;Femme boys&rsquo;. And there was one other minor change; &ldquo;I know you hate me. I <em>know</em> what you two say about me behind my back,&rdquo; Either way, I decided to file that away for later&mdash;I had more important stuff to worry about for now; like not getting my skull crushed. </p>
<p >As soon as Gary started climbing the ladder, I tugged on Jimmy&rsquo;s shirtsleeve frantically. &ldquo;Do you have your skateboard?&rdquo; Jimmy blinked, seemingly unsure of whether he should listen to me or Gary, but shook his head. <em>Crap&mdash;oh well.</em> We could manage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine&mdash;&rdquo; I gestured to my backpack, explaining &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some soda in here to restore health, and I can spend time distracting and dodging while you deal damage, alright?&rdquo; Jimmy was clearly surprised by the well-thought out plan, but only had time to nod before being distracted by Russell&rsquo;s intimidating entrance. I was less so, but then I already knew the large boy&rsquo;s&hellip; simple attack strategy. If you could even call it that. &lt;INCOMPLETE&gt; </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 28.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">~~~ </p>
<p >The betrayal in Jimmy&rsquo;s voice when he said &ldquo;What the hell, Gary? I thought we were friends!&rdquo; always gave me a clenching feeling in my chest. And I could feel the emotional pain even though I was breathing like a bellows and was pretty sure I&rsquo;d be one big bruise by morning. <em>Really gotta&hellip; check out&hellip; that asthma&hellip;</em> </p>
<p >When I finally tuned back in, it was right on time. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken <em>dumps</em> that had more brains than you, <strong>friend</strong>,&rdquo; Gary said it with such gleeful venom, I felt myself still get a little mad about it even though I&rsquo;d already heard it. &ldquo;No&hellip; I&rsquo;m taking <em>over</em> this school! An&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >But I interrupted him. &ldquo;WRONG!&rdquo; The outburst was so sudden, Jimmy jumped a little and Gary actually stopped talking to stare at me. I straightened up, finally catching my breath as I looked Gary straight in the eye and said again, very clearly, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong.&rdquo; </p>
<p >His eyebrows shot up at that, but he said in a cordial tone, &ldquo;Is that <em>so</em>, little Petey?&rdquo; Gary didn&rsquo;t seem to know whether he should grin or glare at me. &ldquo;About <em>what</em>?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I narrowed my eyes and adopted as firm a stance as I could despite the aches throughout my body. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to take over the school.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary immediately shot back, &ldquo;And why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I shrugged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simple; I won&rsquo;t let you.&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s shocked expression was almost worth all the worrying; being able to actually get <strong>something</strong> through that thick skull of his was so infrequent that I felt myself smirk. </p>
<p >But the satisfaction only lasted a moment, because Gary quickly began mirroring how I felt&mdash;but in a far more gleeful way. Gary was scanning me now, the way he did when I did something or knew something I shouldn&rsquo;t, but it was a far more intense scrutiny than usual, and he looked almost <em>giddy</em>. Like he&rsquo;d just found a toy he&rsquo;d never noticed tucked away somewhere. &ldquo;Aw, this is just <em>precious</em>!&rdquo; He practically spat the last word, continuing, &ldquo;A girl and her mutt, aw, I think I&rsquo;m gonna <em>cry</em>! Just like you, Femme Boy!&rdquo; He laughed as if this was the most hilarious thing he&rsquo;d ever heard. &ldquo;Do you honestly think <em>you</em> can stop me, Kowalski?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t know if he could; all I knew was that I was <em>tired</em> of sitting on the sidelines, letting Jimmy do all the legwork while I desperately tried to fly a burning plane. I snarled (as best I could with my voice) &ldquo;<em>Please</em>; I can predict what you&rsquo;re gonna do in my <em>sleep</em>. It&rsquo;s almost <strong>boring</strong> by now.&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s jubilant expression switched to barely-contained rage. <em>Yeah, </em>FUCK <em>you, Gary.</em> </p>
<p >Even so, Gary smiled thinly. &ldquo;Well then. I guess we&rsquo;ll be in for an interesting school year, eh loser? Moron?&rdquo; He cackled, turning around as he shouted behind him &ldquo;See you around!&rdquo; and disappeared up the passage. I resisted the temptation to stomp my foot in frustration; he <em>always</em> had to have the last word! </p>
<p >Behind me I could hear Jimmy helping Russell to his feet, explaining that Gary had been lying about the &lsquo;farmyard&rsquo; animals, and that he should stop bullying me and himself. Then he came up to me, and didn&rsquo;t say anything for a while. Eventually he put a hand on my shoulder and asked quietly &ldquo;Hey, man.... you okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I sighed, but nodded. As soon as Gary had shown up muttering to himself this was how it&rsquo;d have to go&mdash;I simply couldn&rsquo;t let Gary wreak havoc on things and potentially hurt Jimmy. And if convincing him to keep taking his meds didn&rsquo;t work, well&hellip; I figured I didn&rsquo;t have any choice but to stop him directly. I smiled back at Jimmy, and suggested we get going&mdash;we had a lot of work ahead of us, after all. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >It had started out easy enough, with Gary following his typical strategy of setting Jimmy up to fall. I hadn&rsquo;t bothered waiting for Jimmy to ask me for advice for the preps, I&rsquo;d just immediately suggested the tournament. And I actually watched that time&mdash;although it&rsquo;d devolved into a regular brawl right after, which didn&rsquo;t really help. But it was still nice being included. So I had been feeling pretty good with the Preps already dealt with, and decided to start getting headway on the Greasers; additionally, I&rsquo;d started talk to Crabblesnitch, trying to convince him to listen to me about Gary. I hadn&rsquo;t had much luck yet, but the Headmaster <em>had</em> called me &lsquo;Kowabee&rsquo;, which was the closest to my actual name the man had ever gotten. </p>
<p >It was after winter break that it all started to spin out of control. That was around the time Lola began talking to me; honestly it just kind of baffled me more than anything. She&rsquo;d thank me for holding a door open with a wink, she would stay late after English and ask about the materiel we&rsquo;d discussed in class, really weird stuff like that. I shouldered my bag as I thought. <em>It&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s </em>hitting<em> on me or something.</em> I nearly snorted at the thought&mdash;yeah right; Lola Lombardi, arguably the hottest girl in school (not that there was much competition for the title), interested in <em>me</em>? Not fucking likely. But I couldn&rsquo;t really think of what would prompt her to even do this. As if on cue, behind me I heard a sultry &ldquo;Hey, cutie; care to walk a sweet girl to her next class?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I moved the door on my locker to reveal Lola leaning against the locker next to his, one hand behind her back and the other dangling coyly from her mouth. She smirked as I felt uncomfortable at the nick-name. Something about it felt eerily familiar. &ldquo;Hi, Lola. Uh, I guess it depends on the class?&rdquo; I glanced at my watch as I grabbed the last book out of my locker and swung it shut. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got Shop next, so if yours is on the way there,&rdquo; Shouldering my backpack, I swallowed and tried to keep my eyes on her face which was <em>such</em> a clich&eacute;, but despite the extra years I&rsquo;d been living in the loops I had been learning the hard way my body was stuck the way it was&mdash;which meant that I got to live through puberty for as long as I was trapped in these loops. Wonderful. </p>
<p >She smiled as she pushed herself off the locker. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfect, my next class is right there! We can go together,&rdquo; I was surprised by how genuinely happy she seemed as we walked down the hallway together. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s&hellip; uh, cool?&rdquo; I nearly slapped myself in the face&mdash;geez, talk about awkward. To cover it up, I quickly asked &ldquo;So, do you&hellip; um&hellip; like working on bikes?&rdquo; </p>
<p >She seemed amused by my embarrassment, chuckling as she said &ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re cute when you blush!&rdquo; I groaned as we descended the main staircase. Answering my question, she said &ldquo;Oh, bikes are alright. I&rsquo;m more interested in riding&hellip; other things&rdquo; emphasizing her point by bumping her hip into mine. </p>
<p >Even though my crotch had decided to start sending out signals at that contact, I laughed at the joke. &ldquo;Haha! That&rsquo;s pretty funny; hey, have you met Jimmy?&rdquo; </p>
<p >She nodded, raising an eyebrow. &ldquo;Pretty sure everybody&rsquo;s &lsquo;met&rsquo; him; the whole school can&rsquo;t seem to stop talking about him.&rdquo;&lt;&gt; shook her head, indicating I should continue as I pushed the door to leave the school open. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend of mine; I think he memorized a whole sex joke book at some point&mdash;he&rsquo;d probably appreciate that one.&rdquo; I snickered to myself, remembering one that Jimmy&rsquo;d told me a few weeks ago. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Oh? You two must be <em>very</em> close&hellip;&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t noticed that she&rsquo;d started walking closer to me, and was now hooking our arms together until she said quietly near my ear &ldquo;Being comfortable with your sexuality like that must take a lot of trust.&rdquo; I felt my heart-rate pick up considerably. </p>
<p >My body was wracked with a shiver at the breath that I could swear left my ear way hotter than it had been a moment ago, not to mention the way she was pressing herself into my side. I began babbling &ldquo;Oh&hellip; um&hellip; wha? Yeah, we.. trust each other..&rdquo; By now we were in the Auto Shop area, and the place was generally deserted&mdash;everybody was in class. Even if I had wanted to, I doubted I could have moved as Lola began nuzzling my ear, trailing her nose along my neck. My eyes slid shut at the contact; Why does that feel so good? &ldquo;Uhhh~&rdquo; </p>
<p >As Lola shifted her position to be more at my front, I distantly felt a brick wall press into my back. Then she began licking my lips and there was a tongue in my mouth and I couldn&rsquo;t really think that well honestly. The world didn&rsquo;t vanish in an instant like in novels, nor did it send shockwaves of pleasure running through my body. But a subtle haze obscured everything that wasn&rsquo;t a sensation related to the light nibbling of my lower lip she was doing now. In between it all, she began guiding my hands to rest on her hips, leaning forward to purr &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a loooong time since a newbie like you came my way, cutie~&rdquo; as she pressed a knee against my crotch. I gasped in surprise; there were so many sensations&mdash;and it was so hot but ooooh so good. The subtly of Lola smirking against my neck as she dragged her lower lip over my throat was totally lost in the din of heat and pressure. </p>
<p >While it did feel <em>really</em> good, there was a portion of my brain that was still operating, and it was very confused. <em>Why is this happening?</em> I forced my eyes open, breathing out a very articulate &ldquo;Ummm, wha&ndash;&rdquo; But at that moment she pushed herself off the wall and away from me. </p>
<p >She chuckled, waving as she strolled away with a &ldquo;Heh, you&rsquo;re adorable! See you &lsquo;round, cutie~....&rdquo; And I was left dazed against the wall, blinking as my brain tried to catch up to what had just happened. </p>
<p >Mindlessly I grabbed the backpack I&rsquo;d let fall to the ground in the thick of things and walk into the Shop classroom, mind still reeling as I set my bag down. <em>What was that oh my God did a girl really just kiss me holy crap did </em>Lola<em> really just kiss me what is going on</em>&ndash; &ldquo;Femme Boy! Fancy seeing you here!&rdquo; I let out an undignified squeak at the sudden noise to my left. I didn&rsquo;t even have the awareness to glare at Gary as he chuckled. &ldquo;Hehe, aw Pete&hellip;&rdquo; he leaned forward, looking at my crotch as he said &ldquo;Is that a roll of coins in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I tried to say something resembling speech, but the fact was that Gary&rsquo;s greeting had startled me so much and the hormones still flooded in my bloodstream were too much. I crossed my arms and buried my head in them, trying to shut everything out. All I managed to mutter was &ldquo;I thought you weren&rsquo;t talking to me anymore.&rdquo; Gary had taken to ignoring me most of the time, even though we did share the same Shop and History classes&mdash;or he&rsquo;d stay out as late as possible so we didn&rsquo;t cross paths in our dorm room. </p>
<p >Gary chuckled, patting me on the back as he sat down in the chair next to me. &ldquo;I always have time for my favorite little girl!&rdquo; I just closed my eyes and sighed. <em>I don&rsquo;t want to be here.</em> For a few moments, all I could hear was the sound of work being done on cars. Luckily, the teacher couldn&rsquo;t see that I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything, since Peanut and Richie were working on the car in front of the freshman bike table. Then, Gary prodded my shoulder. &ldquo;&hellip;Come on, what&rsquo;s got your panties in a twist today?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I barely had the energy to groan &ldquo;Just leave me alone, Gary....&rdquo; I&rsquo;d never even really thought about what my first kiss would be like, but it sure wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em>. With some girl I hardly even knew, and who just&hellip; just up and left right after? <em>But do I even have the right to complain? I&rsquo;ll probably never even get kissed again....</em> </p>
<p >Gary didn&rsquo;t say anything for a while, but it seemed eventually his patience ran out and he sounded confused. &ldquo;What, are you just gonna lie there? Aren&rsquo;t you even going to talk about it?&rdquo; I just buried my head further in my arms. Just my luck that this happened right before a class with <em>Gary</em> of all people; was getting some peace and quiet to process my feelings really too much to ask? Somebody prodded between my shoulder blades, my ear, and my armpit, but I just pretended like I couldn&rsquo;t feel anything. <em>He has to get bored eventually.</em> </p>
<p >Gary let out a frustrated huff, then began tugging on my hair. Lightly at first, then he gave a sudden <strong>yank</strong>. &ldquo;OW! What the fuck, man!?&rdquo; I held a hand to my head protectively, glaring at Gary and saying &ldquo;Since when do you care about me anyway?&rdquo; as I hid myself in my arm cocoon again. </p>
<p >Soon, I felt Gary lean down and hiss&mdash;so low that only I could hear &ldquo;Wow Petey; you&rsquo;re right! I <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> care about you!&rdquo; And he moved away, leaving me to my melancholy thoughts. <em>Good riddance.</em> </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >Jimmy was rather surprised, to say the least, upon seeing lipstick smeared up and down my neck. I was just as surprised as Jimmy, but I didn&rsquo;t feel that a cordial slap on the back and high-five was the appropriate response. My immediate reaction was to clutch at my neck, trying to wipe the stain off, but it didn&rsquo;t go away; so I scampered off to the bathroom, trying to hide how red my face was. I then spent the rest of the evening dodging Jimmy&rsquo;s questions&mdash;I just wanted to put it out of my mind. </p>
<p >That night, I reasoned with myself that it probably didn&rsquo;t matter in the long run anyway. <em>It&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;s going to want to kiss me again.</em> It didn&rsquo;t really stop me from remembering the flood of heat to my groin when she&rsquo;d ground her knee into my crotch. I swallowed, <em>acutely aware</em> of the fact that Gary could be back any minute&mdash;that&rsquo;d make this <em>really</em> awkward. But I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it; and it was funny, the more I pondered what had happened, the more I realized that what Lola had done was what, usually, the guy was supposed to do. I frowned up at the celling in perplexing. <em>Like, what, I&rsquo;m supposed to be the one that wants </em>her<em>?</em> I&rsquo;d spent my whole life wanting other people&mdash;wanting friends, wanting somebody to listen to me, wanting to not get beat up.... I turned over onto my side toward the bookshelves, smiling slightly to myself. <em>It&rsquo;s kind of nice to feel </em>wanted<em> for a change, even if it was just a one-time thing.</em> </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >The next few days let me put the whole Lola issue&mdash;ahem&mdash;to bed, as it were; the Greasers were getting way more restless, exhibiting their late-February, early-March hostility toward Jimmy. <em>Geez, it&rsquo;s only mid-January!</em> But, inexplicably, they started acting the same way toward me as well. It was <em>weird</em>. Usually the only clique that paid me any mind were the Nerds, and that was only to tell me that I was too weird for their gang. People were tripping me in the halls, spray-painting my locker, and Jimmy even beat up one that had been pestering me outside the dorm. Jimmy honestly seemed more pissed that they were messing with me than that they were doing the same thing to him. When I asked about this, Jimmy had looked astonished. &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s cool if they do it to me, I can take it!&rdquo; So it rather put the whole Lola thing on the back-burner when my first priority was to figure out what Gary was doing this time around. <em>Not that I knew what he was doing the first two times, exactly....</em> </p>
<p >Then it became rather intensely relevant when I was interrupted by a voice calling my name in a crowded hallway as I made my way to History. &ldquo;Yoo-hoo! Petey!&rdquo; That stopped me dead in my tracks as I looked around the sea of faces to try and see who it might have been. The only people who called me &lsquo;Petey&rsquo; were really Gary and the Nerds (everybody else just said &lsquo;you&rsquo; or &lsquo;pink-shirt kid&rsquo;, if they bothered addressing me at all), and it hadn&rsquo;t sounded like Gary.... Then, Lola squeezed her way through the stream of bodies to smile coyly at me. When she got close enough, she said &ldquo;Miss me, cutie-pie?&rdquo; and draped herself across my shoulders before I even had time to blink. </p>
<p >We made our way through the crowd like that, though I noticed that the students seemed to move out of Lola&rsquo;s way far more than they did for me. <em>Makes sense; I&rsquo;m practically invisible around here.</em> Though that was not the case now&mdash;not many people were staring or gaping, but there were enough eyes trained on me that I felt my stomach start twisting into knots. I hated being the center of attention; instead I began talking to distract myself. &ldquo;UmI&rsquo;msorrycanyourepeatthat?&rdquo; <em>Oh God get me </em>out<em> of here!</em> </p>
<p >Lola didn&rsquo;t seem uncomfortable with the attention in the slightest&mdash;in fact, she seemed to relish it. She did seem confused with my question, though. After a moment, she said &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, I know someplace we can be <em>alone</em>.&rdquo; I nodded, though her tone made me frown as she took the lead in pulling me along. <em>What is going </em>on<em>!?</em> Something was <em>definitely</em> off about this situation. </p>
<p >For politeness&rsquo;s sake, I said &ldquo;Where&rsquo;re we going?&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t answer, but eventually we were making our way up the staircase to the less-used third floor of the building. &ldquo;Oh, okay.&rdquo; She confidently opened the door to one of the rooms, and it turned out to be an old classroom. There was a teacher&rsquo;s desk at the front, but the student&rsquo;s desks had clearly been reduced in number, presumably being taken downstairs for active use. I was surprised that nothing seemed overtly dusty. As I studied the room, Lola sauntered over to the larger desk at the front and gracefully hopped up onto it to face me. </p>
<p >Nothing happened for a few moments as the two teenagers just made steady eye-contact, one confident, the other uncertain. Then Lola shrugged off her leather jacket, smirking as she tossed it to the ground with a soft <em>plop</em>. I noted that it was surprisingly loud in this room&mdash;like the empty space was trying to make itself feel less lonely by echoing the sounds around more. I swallowed as she reached up and untied her winter scarf so the contour of her breasts could be easily seen through her turtleneck sweater. My brain was one giant tug-of-war at this point; on one end it was confused about what was happening and why, and why the circumstances were so unusual&mdash;the other wanted to see if she&rsquo;d be interested in a repeat of last time. Eventually I managed to tear my eyes away, look at the floor, the desks, the windows, the door that was shut, so long as it wasn&rsquo;t her. This silence and awkward avoidance of eye-contact continued for a solid minute before Lola let out a peeved huff. &ldquo;Look, the shy act is cute and all but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with looking.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> Who said it was an act? </em>  I shook my head; she was right, I was being silly. I made my way over to one of the chairs in the room, looking back at her and adding &ldquo;Sorry, I suppose you&rsquo;re right, I just&hellip;&rdquo; I sighed as I crossed my arms across the back of a chair &ldquo;I dunno&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >Lola looked at me appraisingly for a moment before saying somewhat hesitantly &ldquo;Listen, don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way, but&hellip; are you gay?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I sighed, annoyed. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m&hellip;&rdquo; I laughed a little, continuing &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <em>defiantly</em> attracted to you, I just&hellip;&rdquo; I frowned, looking out the window as I continued &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t get why you&rsquo;re acting like you&rsquo;re into me all of the sudden?&rdquo; When I looked back at her, she was tilting her head and smiling slightly. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;m just acting?&rdquo; I blinked, frowning thoughtfully as she slipped off the desk and made her way over to the chair I was braced against. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Well, I just mean&hellip; I mean, it really wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for you to be attracted to <em>me</em>, you know?&rdquo; My semi-question hung in the air for a bit, and I watched her lips&mdash;this time I was able to note the heavily-applied lipstick&mdash;as she pursed them in thought. </p>
<p >Eventually, she gave me a small smile. &ldquo;Really, Petey&hellip; you&rsquo;re attractive, why wouldn&rsquo;t I like you?&rdquo; <em>&hellip;whaaaat?</em> I just tilted my head and gave her a dumb-founded look. Peter Kowalski? Attractive? My parents and relatives called me cute all the time of course, but nobody else had. Well, except Jimmy; but he was practically family at this point anyway. She broke me out of my thoughts by kneeling onto the chair so her face was right in front of his. &ldquo;How about I <em>show</em> you how much I like you?&rdquo; She was snaking one arm behind my neck and walking the fingers of the other up my arm. </p>
<p >The tug-of-war had mostly been silenced by now, with the confusion about why anybody would even be into me taking up the front of my mind&mdash;but the lust was fast returning. Damn, I had to admit, she was <em>hot</em>. I took a breath and said (probably against my better judgement) &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; But then she was smiling and putting her lips on his and I figured I could regret this later. </p>
<p >She started simple this time, encouraging me to experiment a little. I tried doing some of the stuff she&rsquo;d done last time, like nibbling on her lip or sucking on her tongue; she tightened the grip she had on the back of my neck in response, so I figured she liked it. Soon, she pulled back and guided me to sit in the chair with her. It&hellip; it was fun. It was a little awkward, but as I got into the rhythm of it I found myself getting more handsy&mdash;I started running a hand over her abdomen, even. That made her chuckle and start doing that&hellip; thing with my neck and <em>gosh</em> that felt good. This time she was licking and sucking and lapping at my throat and my breath quickened. I reached up to put a hand on the back of her head, which made her chuckle and say quietly &ldquo;Aw, you like that?&rdquo; I nodded as she resumed her task, and I closed my eyes and felt it all&mdash;it really did feel good to be wanted. </p>
<p >Eventually, though, a thought occurred to me; <em>class! I have class right now!</em> &ldquo;Crap! I&hellip; shoot&hellip;&rdquo; Lola stopped at that. </p>
<p >&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I groaned, embarrassed I hadn&rsquo;t thought of this earlier. </p>
<p >&ldquo;I just&hellip; I have class right now&hellip;&rdquo; She giggled at that, pulling away to give me a coy smile. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re <em>adorable</em>.&rdquo; And somehow, that didn&rsquo;t feel like an insult like it normally did. She sighed, but nodded. &ldquo;I suppose I do to.&rdquo; I moved to get off her, wondering how I was going to hide the bulge in my pants. She went to gather up her coat and scarf, saying &ldquo;How about we continue this after school?&rdquo; I looked over to see she was smirking and I flinched&mdash;<em>she looks weirdly like Gary when she does that</em>. </p>
<p >Even so, I shivered at the suggestion. &ldquo;Um&hellip; sure?&rdquo; I was pretty sure I was blushing like crazy as she tied her scarf. &ldquo;Where would you wanna meet?&rdquo; </p>
<p >She looked thoughtful upon finishing the knot, and bent down to pick up her jacket. &ldquo;Hm, it depends on how far we wanna go....&rdquo; I swallowed and she chuckled at my expression. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, doesn&rsquo;t have to be full-on sex or anything.&rdquo; She tapped a chin upon finally shrugging her jacket back on. &ldquo;Hm&hellip; You could sneak into the girl&rsquo;s dorm through the&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;&mdash;vine grower thing on the north side?&rdquo; She looked surprised, and I shrugged as we made our way to the door. &ldquo;Jimmy asked for my help doing something for Burton once, so he showed me that way of getting in.&rdquo; I rolled my eyes; how Jimmy hadn&rsquo;t noticed it was just an old man trying to get access to underage girls&rsquo; underpants I&rsquo;d never understand. </p>
<p >She snickered as she passed me holding the door, slapping me on the butt as she said &ldquo;Heh, the nice ones <em>always</em> have a bad-boy streak.&rdquo; I was too busy scooping my backpack up and trying to ignore the fact that I was just <em>slapped on the ass</em> to reply. Luckily, she kept talking after hooking her arm into his. &ldquo;Mm, that Jimmy kid sure is making a name for himself....&rdquo; I nodded as we made our way to the stairway. It was hardly anything new to me. &ldquo;You two seem awfully close.&rdquo; She looked at me sidelong as we descended the stairs. </p>
<p >I nodded. &ldquo;Well yeah, he&rsquo;s my only friend, really.&rdquo; Sheesh, that sounded pathetic when I said that out loud. Oh well, no changing the facts. We&rsquo;d made it to my classroom by now, so I turned toward her, rubbing the back of my head awkwardly. &ldquo;So&hellip; uh, do you want me to meet in your room after school?&rdquo; </p>
<p >She smirked, nodding and tapping her finger on the tip of my nose as she unhooked our arms, adding &ldquo;Mmhm&mdash;don&rsquo;t keep me waiting, cutie~&rdquo; before waving and sauntering away down the hall. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >I entered History class in a bit of a daze&mdash;but this time, it was a happy kind. <em>A girl </em><strong>likes</strong><em> me!?</em> Hell, I&rsquo;d honestly been expecting a guy to be the first person to actually show interest in me. But&hellip; just&hellip; wow! I put my bookbag down, grinning to myself like a loon as the teacher took roll. I barely noticed the teacher apologizing for losing his glasses. &ldquo;I swear, you&rsquo;d think after twenty years I&rsquo;d know how to keep them by now!&rdquo; Soon, though, I shook myself out of reminiscing and forced myself to focus. <em>I&rsquo;ll be able to think about it after school all I want.</em> That thought filled me up with a breathless giddiness that I couldn&rsquo;t fully contain as the teacher explained we&rsquo;d be starting a group project today. Everybody groaned when he held up a list of already-chosen groups. I remembered this, vaguely. I&rsquo;d been with the black-haired girl and&ndash;<em>oh no&hellip;</em>&ndash;a Greaser. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> Crap&hellip; oh well, nothing I can do about it. </em>  Maybe I&rsquo;d be able to talk to them and figure out why the Greasers were being so douchey to me in addition to Jimmy? I looked over my shoulder at Gary as the teacher began reading off names. He looked smug about something&mdash;not that that said much. He looked like that all the time. &ldquo;Group 3: &hellip;&ndash;oh dear, um&hellip; Koh-wall-ski? Ms. Ng, I believe, and&hellip; ah, Smith.&rdquo; I whipped my head around to stare at the teacher, but he was already squinting at the next group in the list. </p>
<p >I was now on high-alert&mdash;something different wasn&rsquo;t always super note-worthy, but that usually was when things were different each time. But this had been the same each time! The din of chairs scraping as people got up and began grouping up served as background noise while I was frozen in my chair, all traces of giddiness having fled. <em>Gary must&rsquo;ve set this up, he </em>had<em> to!</em> I stood up, waving to Angie, who had grabbed her bag and made her way over&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t see Gary in the forest of people. &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s Petey, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I held back the sigh, simply saying, &ldquo;I prefer Pete&rdquo; as I scanned the room. <em>What could he possibly be planning?</em> What was different about this time? Well&hellip; I swallowed as I remembered what had just happened. <em>But that&rsquo;s just for </em>me<em>, it&rsquo;s not like that&rsquo;s got anything to do with him!</em> </p>
<p >In the meantime, Angie was nodding. &ldquo;Oh, okay. So&hellip; um&hellip;&rdquo; She looked a little awkward as she sat down. &ldquo;What do you think of the assignment?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I hadn&rsquo;t even gotten the paper, but I remembered this one alright&mdash;the project was to research a female figure of United States history and create a presentation about our person to present to the class. The last two times around, Angie and I had got stuck with all the work, since Hal (who was actually a grade above them, but hadn&rsquo;t passed History last year) had refused to do anything. In my opinion, we hadn&rsquo;t done too well&mdash;what I&rsquo;d managed to research about Abigail Adams indicated that she was actually a really interesting person, but there hadn&rsquo;t been enough time to make the presentation very good. But before I could say anything, a familiar voice cut in. &ldquo;I have no idea, I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention.&rdquo; Gary plopped himself down at the desk next to me, propping his head up on his elbow and mock-whispering, &ldquo;Too busy trying to keep Petey&rsquo;s afterglow from stabbing me in the eyesocket.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Angie looked surprised at the secretive way Gary was acting, glancing at me, confused. &ldquo;Oh&hellip; uh, do you want me to read the inst&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >But Gary was waving a hand, interrupting her. &ldquo;Bah, who cares about <em>that</em>, I could do this old fool&rsquo;s assignments in my <em>sleep</em>.&rdquo; He made seemingly-friendly eye-contact with me, but the way his knee was bouncing belied his inner glee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <em>much</em> more interested to hear who the lucky lady is!&rdquo; Leaning forward, he added &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, Petey, give us the scoop!&rdquo; </p>
<p >I could feel my face heating, <em>fast</em>, with Angie looking at me in somewhat of a bewildered fashion, and Gary clearly in prime hunting mode. <em>He always knows when you&rsquo;re least expecting him.</em> I managed to stammer out, &ldquo;Co-come on, let&rsquo;s just do the assignment!&rdquo; <em>Oh my God is that really the best I can do? Sheesh!</em> I shook my head, trying to get into &lsquo;Gary mode&rsquo;. I sighed; <em>always playing catch-up&mdash;the story of my life.</em> </p>
<p >Gary grinned at my reply. &ldquo;Oooh, she&rsquo;s <em>shy</em>!&rdquo; He leaned back over to Angie, blinking imploringly at her and saying, &ldquo;Could you lend me a hand? Femme Boy here might need a spot of encouragement; perhaps if a lovely young maiden were to ask him?&rdquo; And he smiled what I had to admit was a genuinely charming smile, which made Angie giggle, look away, and twirl her hair with a finger. Of course, Gary rolling his eyes as soon as she wasn&rsquo;t looking was less charming. </p>
<p >I swallowed, trying to speed my brain up to catch up with Gary&rsquo;s. <em>What is this all about?</em> I frowned; <em>is he trying to get me to tell Angie about Lola? How could he even know about that? It </em>just<em> happened!</em> Angie interrupted my thoughts by asking, &ldquo;We <em>are</em> going to be in the same group for a while&hellip;&rdquo; She smiled a little apologetically, like she knew it was wrong to ask. &ldquo;maybe just say whether your friend is right or not?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I glared at Gary, saying as evenly as I could, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s <em>not</em> my friend. And it&rsquo;s not your business&rdquo; I knew that was a mistake when Gary&rsquo;s smirk only grew wider&mdash;and crueler. </p>
<p >He tsked. &ldquo;Petey, Petey, Petey&hellip; I do believe thou doth protest too much!&rdquo; He shrugged and picked up his assignment sheet, lazily saying, &ldquo;Really, I&rsquo;d have thought you&rsquo;d <em>jump</em> at this chance.&rdquo; I scrunched my face up in confusion; what did <em>that</em> mean? As Gary scanned the paper, he continued, &ldquo;But like you said, we&rsquo;re not friends; so what do I know? Anyhow, I was thinking&hellip; Dorothy Vaughan. What about you?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I squeezed my eyes shut as Angie said, &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; I really, <em>really</em> hated playing right into Gary&rsquo;s hands like this. But I also knew I was never going to figure out what he was trying to do if I didn&rsquo;t keep Gary talking. </p>
<p >I said, quite carefully, &ldquo;What &lsquo;opportunity&rsquo; are you talking about?&rdquo; Gary smirked. <em>Well at least I could tell that was what he wanted, even if I did it anyway.</em> </p>
<p >He let the paper flutter back onto the desk and leaned back in his chair, putting his hands behind his head as he responded, &ldquo;Why, the opportunity to prove me wrong, of course!&rdquo; He grinned at my clear confusion, but spared me the need to ask by continuing. &ldquo;People&rsquo;ve been making fun of your sexuality for, what, three years now, Femme Boy? Four?&rdquo; Honestly I don&rsquo;t really remember when I&rsquo;d first been called a &lsquo;fag&rsquo;&mdash;the frequency had spiked considerably since everybody entered sixth grade, but with the difference in how I perceived time I just shrugged in response to Gary&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;All your life. But you&rsquo;ve finally got evidence to the contrary! A real, honest-to-god sexual encounter!&rdquo; </p>
<p >&lt;third&gt;my eyes widened, and he swallowed; okay, <em>that</em> could not have been a coincidence&mdash;maybe he could deny it? Subtly? &ldquo;Wha&hellip; what&rsquo;re you talking about? I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I mean, I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; he rubbed the back of my head awkwardly, looking over at Angie apologetically. <em>She really doesn&rsquo;t deserve to hear this.</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Pete, don&rsquo;t <em>lie</em>.&rdquo; He flinched&mdash;that phrase always reminds me of the first time through. Even so, Gary shrugged. &ldquo;But hey, have it your way. Let&rsquo;s guess who it was, hm?&rdquo; </p>
<p >At this point, Angie was looking increasingly awkward and worried. Now she decided to speak up, albeit tentatively. &ldquo;Hey, uh&hellip; maybe we should get to work on our project? Who, uh, who was that person you said, Gary?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary turned to her, a disappointed look on his face. &ldquo;Really, Angie? Don&rsquo;t you know a scoop when you see it?&rdquo; He nodded toward me, saying, &ldquo;I mean, look at the way he&rsquo;s blushing and avoiding the question. It&rsquo;s <em>gotta</em> be somebody important if Pete doesn&rsquo;t want to brag about it.&rdquo; To my horror, Angie began frowning at me thoughtfully. </p>
<p >I began squirming in my chair, saying quietly &ldquo;Gary, <em>please</em>, cut it out!&rdquo; He felt like an animal being dissected on a lab table&mdash;like all my secrets were being laid bare. </p>
<p >But Gary paid me no heed, instead reaching over and shoving my head back suddenly. &ldquo;Now, that shade of lipstick&mdash;&rdquo; I pulled my head away forcefully, but Gary continued, making eye-contact with Angie as if they were discussing the latest sports statistics. &ldquo;&mdash;is only worn by four people in this school.&rdquo; He held up a hand, counting his fingers one-by-one as he listed names. &ldquo;Christy, Lola, Miss Danvers, and Gord.&rdquo; As he talked, he moved his fingers back down. &ldquo;Danvers we can rule out because she only has eyes for Crabblesnatch and wouldn&rsquo;t risk getting fired over something as stupid as kissing a minor, and Gord only wears that particular shade in private.&rdquo; I quietly let the embarrassment fill me up as he licked my palm and started rubbing the mark off. <em>Note to self; do </em>not<em> leave post-makeout situation without checking reflection first.</em> &ldquo;Christy is, frankly, not a scandalous enough option for Petey to be so secretive about it, which just leaves....&rdquo; He raised his eyebrows, tilting his head at Angie knowingly. </p>
<p >For her part, she gasped in just the right place. &ldquo;Oh my God, really?&rdquo; She looked back at me, who had decided to hide behind the assignment worksheet even though he pretty much already knew what it said. &ldquo;I mean, Christy mentioned something like that, but&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >I couldn&rsquo;t see Gary, but he replied with &ldquo;She does tend to exaggerate. So! Who&rsquo;s up for Dorothy Vaughan? Hm?&rdquo; I was used to Gary&rsquo;s tendency to abruptly switch topics, but Angie was thrown for a bit of a loop and just nodded dumbly as Gary talked about a woman instrumental in the Space Race from NASA. As he listened, I realized that that had been Gary&rsquo;s plan all along; ensuring that the news of my makeout session with Lola made it to the more trusted of Bullworth&rsquo;s gossips.<em> Gary </em>knew<em> that was what had happened as soon as I stepped in here!</em> Shop class from the other day suddenly reared its head, and he realized that maybe it was even before that. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> He was the reason Lola started doing all that stuff to me in the first place! </em>  When framed in that light, it all made so much more sense&mdash;and come to think of it the last two times, Lola had been pretty central to the conflict with the Greasers. <em>That&rsquo;s right, the whole thing with Johnny started because he thought Jimmy was sleeping with Lola!</em> He only just refrained from slapping myself in the face for being stupid enough to believe a girl actually liked me. He scooted my chair forward, pretending to listen to Angie and Gary&rsquo;s discussion of planning, tuning in enough only to offer to do anything but public speak. In the meantime, he continued my train of thought. It made a lot of sense; even before he&rsquo;d started attending Bullworth, Johnny was well-known for his jealous streak. Combine that with the fact that the members of his clique seemed to genuinely trust and respect him&hellip; I frowned, and looked over at Gary rapidly bouncing his leg up and down as he rattled off an entire book&rsquo;s worth of information on various historical women Angie and he were debating. How did Gary view this situation? <em>Control Lola, and you control the Greasers.</em> He swallowed; that made a frighteningly large amount of sense. <em>But&hellip; how did Gary get Lola to do all that stuff?</em> In the last two loops, he hadn&rsquo;t gotten the sense that she&rsquo;d done anything she hadn&rsquo;t wanted to do&mdash;honestly, it hadn&rsquo;t even seemed like Gary was even involved in that particular incident beyond Jimmy mentioning he saw Gary in passing trying to get back a Nerd&rsquo;s papers. He rolled my eyes to myself; nobody needed to twist Jimmy&rsquo;s arm to get him to hit on anybody, much less a girl as attractive as Lola. I frowned to myself; me, though. He knew that getting Lola and myself&hellip; together was less likely, seeing as she hadn&rsquo;t treated me like this at all in the previous two loops. So Lola talking with me, flirting with me, and, well, kissing me was because Gary set things up like that. He nearly slapped my hand against my forehead&mdash;duh, <em>that</em> was why the Greasers were so mad at me lately! Because of the rumors about me and Lola! <em>Geez, how insecure does Johnny have to be to think that Lola might leave him for </em>me<em>?</em> Then again, she had certainly <em>seemed</em> interested earlier tod&ndash;he shook my head a little, leaning back and crossing my arms across my chest as he nodded so it seemed like he was listening. <em>If I accept that Gary was behind all this, I have to accept the fact that that was all an act on her part.</em> That made me feel worse than he cared to admit, but then another thought struck me; <em>how did Gary get her to do it?</em> My eyes widened, and he scanned Gary out of the corner of my eye as he seemed to be frantically mime being stabbed&mdash;did he blackmail her into doing it? That made my stomach clench in dread; God, that&rsquo;s <em>horrible</em>! He must&rsquo;ve, there wasn&rsquo;t really any other reason for her to do it! He&rsquo;d have to tell her about it, ask what he&rsquo;d done, and apologize&mdash;Christ, this school was beginning to turn into a gigantic soap opera. </p>
<p >Eventually, the group came to some agreements on what everybody was going to do; my responsibility was research (with Gary&rsquo;s help, since he was the one who had suggested our historical figure) and visual aid crafting. Angie would write the paper, and Angie and Gary would present the visuals together. I had to force myself to keep up the &lsquo;embarrassed my secret got outed&rsquo; motif and not ask Gary why he&rsquo;d do something <em>that</em> horrible. <em>I mean, I knew he was an asshole, but blackmailing somebody into having sex with somebody they don&rsquo;t like? That&rsquo;s just downright despicable!</em> &lt;&gt;Then, I had a huge realization; what if he ratted Gary out about the blackmail? If he just explained the entire situation to Johnny, he would be willing to bet the Greaser King would be a lot more upset about somebody blackmailing his &lsquo;queen&rsquo; than some random kid who happened to get caught in the crossfire. He sighed to myself. <em>Should&rsquo;ve known the first time somebody was into me was because they were blackmailed into it.</em> </p>
<p >As soon as the bell to end class rang he made a beeline for the girl&rsquo;s dorms&mdash;he hoped he&rsquo;d run into Jimmy along the way, but no such luck. Then he looked up the old vine climber, and gulped, shifting the heavy backpack he had on. <em>Hm&hellip; maybe it can support the added weight?</em> He shook it, keeping an eye on the bolts keeping it attached to the wall. It didn&rsquo;t look stable&mdash;there were only two, maybe three wires keeping the whole thing from just falling away. He sighed to myself. <em>Man, this school is such a shitshow.</em> Leaving my backpack on the ground wasn&rsquo;t ideal; he&rsquo;d had my backpack stolen multiple times in this town. He sighed, finally deciding to just bite the bullet and drop my backpack off in my dorm. <em>At least I know Gary won&rsquo;t steal my stuff.</em> Though that thought gave me pause; yesterday he wouldn&rsquo;t have thought Gary capable of blackmailing somebody into having sex with me to manipulate me, either. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> &hellip;I guess I can just bring my wallet with me. </em>  To my surprise, though, as he crossed the cobblestone plaza linking the main building with the two dormitories, he heard the tell-tale sign of a skateboard, followed by an exclaim of pain and a bad-tempered &ldquo;Watch it, leather-face!&rdquo; </p>
<p >He turned around, waving to Jimmy. &ldquo;Hey, Jimmy!&rdquo; The other boy looked over at his name, signature glare softening a bit when he saw it was me. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Pete, yo! What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; He accepted my friend&rsquo;s offered high-five automatically, but he really didn&rsquo;t have much time for small talk. </p>
<p >Mentally running down the list of things that had happened to me today, he let out an overwhelmed laugh. &ldquo;God, a shit-ton! Look, I have to talk to somebody, but I wanna fill you in&mdash;I think I finally figured out how to turn Gary&rsquo;s plan against him!&rdquo; He grinned; that was an accomplishment, even if it was just one little piece in Gary&rsquo;s grand scheme. </p>
<p >Jimmy, for his part, looked impressed. He let out a low whistle. &ldquo;Seriously, bro? Man, you really <em>are</em> sharp.&rdquo; I tried to hold in a stupid grin at the praise&mdash;Jimmy had been a lot more complimentary of me this time around. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Well, um, thanks&rdquo; He shook my head, reminding myself of what needed to be done. &ldquo;Anyway, uh&hellip; can you meet me&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off, thinking. <em>I&rsquo;m not actually sure if Lola will be in her room; I guess it&rsquo;s safe to assume she&rsquo;ll be there pretty soon&mdash;if I had to have sex with somebody to keep something bad from happening I&rsquo;d make sure to be there when they wanted.</em> He would need time to explain what was happening, though. &ldquo;Around five-thirty, behind the Girl&rsquo;s Dorm?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy immediately started grinning, and said &ldquo;Heyyy, is this about the lipsti&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >I cut him off abruptly &ldquo;Yes and no&mdash;it&rsquo;s complicated. So five thirty good?&rdquo; Jimmy nodded and I began moving to go to the dorms again, but he paused. Turning back to Jimmy, he said &ldquo;Hey, um&hellip; would you mind taking my backpack? It&rsquo;s a little heavy....&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jimmy snorted, kicking his skateboard up as he gave it some mock-thought. &ldquo;How &lsquo;bout&hellip; two bucks?&rdquo; He tucked the board under his arm and stuffed his hand in his pocket, quirking a semi-serious eyebrow. </p>
<p >I &lsquo;hm&rsquo;d thoughtfully as he knelt down and extracted my sketchbook and a pencil from my pack&mdash;if he did have to wait for Lola to get there, was gonna want something to do. &ldquo;How about you do it now, and I&rsquo;ll tell you my idea about beating Gary later?&rdquo; </p>
<p >That gave Jimmy pause, and after a moment he shrugged and picked the bag up. &ldquo;Okay, okay, fair &lsquo;nuff.&rdquo; He chuckled as he swung the bag onto his back, adding &ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re the only person with enough balls in this town to actually say somethin&rsquo; like that?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I laughed at that. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about <em>that</em>!&rdquo; He&rsquo;d tried to introduce Jimmy and Zoe to one another early, but trying to talk to Zoe on my own was like courting a bear with chocolates. Either way, he thanked Jimmy, promising to get him lunch some time and making my way back to the Girl&rsquo;s dorm. </p>
<p >A few seconds later though, what was clearly Lola&rsquo;s voice responded &ldquo;Oh, I think I might be able help you out, cutie~.&rdquo; She emerged from the bathroom momentarily, a towel wrapped around her waist and a basket of shower stuff in her hand. Giggling at my surprised expression, she added &ldquo;How unlike a man to ask for directions.&rdquo; With her free hand occupied, she nodded her head at the end of the hall, indicating I should follow. </p>
<p >Which he did, albeit still a little surprised. <em>Man, what&rsquo;re the odds?</em> &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a map of who&rsquo;s dorm room is whose....&rdquo; He shook my head as she shouldered the door to her room open and he entered&mdash;<em>come on, important stuff to talk about Pete, remember?</em> &ldquo;But whatever, I gotta talk to you abou&mdash;&rdquo; he trailed off as he looked around her room as she sat her basket down on a vanity table. </p>
<p >Posters of cars, both in working condition and with all the parts taken out and labeled, adorned almost every available wall surface in half of the room. The bookshelf was mostly free of books, instead containing various mechanical-looking contraptions&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t sure if we were finished or not. One shelf displayed what were, unmistakably, sex toys, in so brazen a fashion it kind of came full circle past embarrassing to just be normal. The room itself? Well, messy; dirty laundry was lying everywhere, and the few books in the room had been dropped unceremoniously by the door, as if eagerly gotten rid of. &ldquo;Sorry about the mess; heh, usually newbies fret about timing&mdash;&rdquo; she glanced back at me from her seat at the vanity table, and I noticed that she wasn&rsquo;t wearing her usual makeup, nor was her hair the way it usually was&mdash;it was kind of curly. &ldquo;I guess you could say you caught me with my pants down around my ankles.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I snorted; Jimmy made a joke like that at least once a month. &ldquo;Hah, sorry! I didn&rsquo;t mean to, uh, catch you off guard.&rdquo; He scratched the back of my neck as she turned back around to mess around with what he figured was various varieties of makeup. </p>
<p >She waved a hand as she got up and made her way to a wardrobe adorned with what appeared to be a poster of different kinds of roads. &ldquo;Oh, not to worry!&rdquo; She smirked as she looked at me over her shoulder as she opened the door. &ldquo;You get a peek behind the curtain, you lucky boy.&rdquo; She then retreated behind the door of the wardrobe and let the towel fall down as she selected clothing. I had to actively remind myself that this was <em>not real</em> and that she was just doing this because she had to. </p>
<p >That didn&rsquo;t give my galloping pulse any respite. &ldquo;Uhhhh okay so I need to ask you a question, is that okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p >She chuckled over the soft rustling of clothing being pulled on over skin. &ldquo;Depends on the question, but now you&rsquo;ve got me curious!&rdquo; </p>
<p >He nodded, then realized that she couldn&rsquo;t see me, and said &ldquo;Okay, um&hellip;&rdquo; He looked around for somewhere to sit, eyes landing on a second bed in the half of the room with no posters, or any personal touches. Perching myself on the edge of the bed a little awkwardly, he said &ldquo;Well, do you know Gary? Gary Smith?&rdquo; </p>
<p >She finally closed the door to the wardrobe, dressed in a t-shirt and&mdash;<em>oh wow okay damn</em>&mdash;booty shorts. She was sporting a confused frown at my question, though. &ldquo;&hellip;Sure, one of the Preps, right? Well&hellip; kind of? He&rsquo;s also not one&hellip;&rdquo; she flopped down onto the bed, adding &ldquo;make yourself at home, cutie!&rdquo; </p>
<p >I bent down to take off my shoes, considering her answer. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve talked to him before?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was my mind playing tricks on me, but she seemed to narrow her eyes suspisciously for just a second before shrugging. &ldquo;A little bit, yeah. But do you really wanna talk about that?&rdquo; She batted her eyelashes coyly as she sat up and trailed a hand up my arm. </p>
<p >I shivered, but I scooted away. &ldquo;Yeah&mdash;see, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; I sighed, not sure how to put all this. &ldquo;See, Gary and I are, um, kind of competing to take over the schooool?&hellip;&rdquo; Wow, that sounded so stupid when I said it like that. </p>
<p >Lola blinked before trying to surpress a laugh. &ldquo;Is that so, then?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I laughed nervously, shrugging. &ldquo;Well, sort of&hellip; more like I&rsquo;m trying to stop him from taking over the school. But, anyway&mdash;see, today he seemed like he knew that you&rsquo;d, um, kissed me earlier, you know?&rdquo; </p>
<p >She quirked an eyebrow before saying lowly &ldquo;Well I <em>did</em> kiss your neck a bit&hellip;&rdquo; and brushing a finger over that spot on my throat. Wait when was she suddenly so close?  </p>
<p style="margin-left: 2.5in; text-indent: -2.5in; line-height: normal;"> ~~~&lt;&gt; </p>
<p >Her mouth curled up into a smirk and she leaned forward. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I clapped my hands together &ldquo;Okay. So. Jimmy and I are both on the Greasers&rsquo; bad side at the moment &lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re, um&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >There was a pause as I tried to think of a word. &ldquo;&hellip;fooling around with?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> I guess that works. </em>  I shrugged, continuing &ldquo;&lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re fooling around with you. But I was thinking if I talked to Johnny first and came clean about what happened, and show that Gary had blackmailed you into doing it, he&rsquo;d probably be way angrier about his blackmailing you than whatever Jimmy or I did.&rdquo; I let her mull it over for a few seconds before continuing &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a couple of holes, though. Like the fact that Gary didn&rsquo;t actually blackmail you, and the fact that we don&rsquo;t know how Gary&rsquo;s been manipulating Johnny, not to mention that neither Johnny nor Gary are exactly stable people, so doing this could be genuinely dangerous.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t have Gary&rsquo;s spooky predictive abilities, so I just wasn&rsquo;t totally sure how this might affect things down the road. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal;"> At that, though, Lola started crawling slowly toward me. &ldquo;I <em>like</em> dangerous~&rdquo; </p>
<p >I grimaced, saying &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s sexy and all? But I mean people getting stabbed, buildings set on fire, you know, people&rsquo;s actual lives and livelihoods being hurt?&rdquo; </p>
<p >She let out a whoosh of air, sitting back on feet. &ldquo;Yeesh, for such a sweet kid your mind goes to some awfully grim places.&rdquo; I shrugged, didn&rsquo;t say anything. Was I willing to do this to Gary? It all came down to why; in the end, there was the possibility of it getting Gary kicked out of school entirely, preventing the whole school-wide chaos and whatnot fiasco. And if I could get that outcome, I wanted to try and take it. Lola finally spoke up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be fine with pretending Gary blackmailed me.&rdquo; She smirked. &ldquo;Johnny will eat it up no matter what I say&mdash;nothing to worry about there. As for the danger thing; there&rsquo;s no <em>safe</em> way of interacting with somebody like that, right? For all I know Johnny could snap tomorrow and start beating up anybody wearing plaid or something.&rdquo; She shrugged. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t live life so afraid of what <em>might</em> happen that you don&rsquo;t do anything at all.&rdquo; I considered that as she resumed her crawling toward me. <em>I suppose that&rsquo;s kind of true? It&rsquo;s about more than just us, thou&mdash;</em>suddenly my school vest was being pulled up and over my head. &ldquo;Speaking of living life to the fullest....&rdquo; As I pulled my vest off the rest of the way I felt her straddle my lap. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we see what else that adorable sex drive wants, hm?&rdquo; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >&lt;maybe show the scene where Lola and Pete convince Johnny instead of just having them fuckin talk about it&mdash;shit&rsquo;s kinda boring&gt;  </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >I was shocked when the plan went off without a hitch. Lola did just what she&rsquo;d said she would, turning the waterworks on and blubbering about the &lsquo;awful things that snake accused her of&rsquo;. It was actually a little disturbing&mdash;even seeing Gary in Shop class with a black eye didn&rsquo;t help. If anything, it curdled my insides more; still, things were moving at a much faster clip than normal. <em>That has to be a good sign, right?</em> I hoped so. </p>
<p >The odd thing about their continuous victories was that Jimmy, rather than becoming more distant, seemed to become even <em>closer</em> to me. Part of that seemed to have to do with how word around school was finally spreading about the new kid and his smart friend who were taking everybody by storm. That meant more attention&hellip; which also meant more bullying. Never had I had so many people waving at me in a friendly fashion while also sticking &lsquo;kick me&rsquo; signs on my back. Somehow, Jimmy was even more violent than usual&mdash;he was constantly threatening people who looked at him funny. &ldquo;Ya gotta show these assholes who&rsquo;s boss, Pete.&rdquo; Even after he beat the Jocks (I only just managed that) Jimmy&rsquo;s newfound popularity and ego somehow combined to this protectiveness to start threatening <em>teachers</em>. </p>
<p >After that, everything went downhill so fast that I was still reeling from it. Jimmy got expelled, all the cliques turned against him, and the school descended into chaos in a record week and a half. <em>Jesus, usually this takes a month!</em> It all came to a head in late April, and somehow I found I was the one chasing Gary through the school, frantically dodging thrown objects and insults. This time around, Gary was sneering about how &ldquo;You had Hopkins do <em>all</em> your dirty work for you, Petey! You did <strong>nothing</strong>! Your little schemes, your little <em>plans</em>, didn&rsquo;t change <em>anything</em>! I won! Me!&rdquo; Then Jimmy burst in, panting something fierce. </p>
<p >&ldquo;You are <em>sad</em>, man! Pete and I worked <em>together</em>, &lsquo;cos that&rsquo;s what friends <strong>do</strong>, stupid! Not that you&rsquo;d know about that.&rdquo; I felt belonging sweep through me at that; that&rsquo;s right, we could do this <em>together</em>.&lt;&gt; </p>
<p >Gary was silent for a few moments, his fists clenching and unclenching at his sides. I had never seen him so livid. Finally, he snarled &ldquo;I may be alone, but at least <em>my</em> mom doesn&rsquo;t whore herself out to abusive old men!&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t remember what happened next very clearly, but there was unintelligible screaming, a board cracking, then more screaming quickly drowned out by a clap of thunder. </p>
<p >The next few days blended into a large, formless mass in my mind. Paramedics zipping up a body bag. Gary needing to be dragged, kicking and screaming, by two people into a white medical van. Police interrogations. Constantly feeling like I was about to throw up. A few days later, Crabblesnitch called me into his office for the usual &lsquo;Head Boy&rsquo; speech, but I declined as politely as I could&mdash;I could barely work up the energy to eat, there was no way I&rsquo;d be able to run a school for a month. The headmaster was surprisingly understanding, suggesting that I talk to the school nurse. </p>
<p >I focused on my schoolwork as much as possible, and I took to avoiding the places I usually went. Nobody really bothered me, which was fine by me. I took to hanging out by the Girl&rsquo;s dorm a lot, actually&mdash;I&rsquo;d climb up the thing on the side and forego the window to instead sit on the roof, sketching the landscape at different times of day. Even on the last day of the loop, I avoided everybody else. Over the course of the month, the same question was chewing at my brain; <em>had Gary meant for that to happen?</em> I&rsquo;d wanted to just let it go, figuring if I didn&rsquo;t think about it it would go away, but it wouldn&rsquo;t leave me alone. As I was trying to ignore the question entirely, the idea to sneak into Happy Volts occurred to me and grew like a cancer the more I tried to ignore it. I knew where Ji&mdash;&hellip; where there was a hidden orderly outfit in my size. I knew where they marked what rooms patients were in. I knew how to distract the guards. I&rsquo;d snuck in twice now, and even if I did get caught, it wasn&rsquo;t like I would be around come tomorrow. I stared across the town at the small brown building I&rsquo;d had to drag a map up here to try and identify as the asylum. <em>I&rsquo;m going to regret not at least trying.</em> I sighed, finally moving my legs only to find they&rsquo;d fallen asleep I&rsquo;d been sitting in the same positon for so long. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >A few hours later, I was stripping out of my uniform and into some orderly scrubs and I was having second thoughts, thoughts I was trying to ignore. <em>If I get in trouble, nothing will happen. I&rsquo;ll wake up at the start of the year.</em> There was still a small part of my brain that couldn&rsquo;t believe in the loops, though, and it kept screaming at me about my parents&rsquo; disappointment, getting in trouble with the law, being attacked by crazy people, all while I snuck in, through windows, around darkened corridors, until I found the control room. Soon, the &lsquo;guard&rsquo; was distracted by a sports match on the television, and left to get a closer look at the TV, leaving me free to navigate through the computer system. <em>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip; oh, patient files!</em> I scrolled through, anxiously switching between the screen and checking to see that the guards were still occupied. Finally, I reached a file titled &ldquo;Smith, Gary&rdquo; <em>Come on&hellip; there&mdash;room 230, block C!</em> I breathed a sigh of relief and quickly closed the file and finder, returning to the operations room and grabbing the key for the room (and the key for the C-block gate) before slipping down the hall. <em>Lucky that&rsquo;s the same block they put Johnny in &hellip;</em> A few coldly-lit, tiled hallways and &lt;&gt; one narrow stairway later I was standing in front of a metal door with a small, clear window. The number was printed clear as day even in the low light; [<u>230 C</u>]. Underneath that there was a small slot for a piece of paper, on which had been written [<u>Smith G.</u>]. The name was clear enough, even though somebody had scribbled over it and written in red [<u>ASSHOLE</u>]. </p>
<p >I swallowed, looking up and down the hallway nervously, but all I could hear was the low buzz of the florescent lights and the echoing sounds of wailing, or whimpering, or screaming. Was I really going to do this? <em>No time like the present, I guess.</em> I wouldn&rsquo;t get this chance again, after all&mdash;unless Jimmy died ag&ndash;I shoved the key into the lock and turned it before I could question what I was doing. </p>
<p >The door swung so easily it slammed shut behind me rather loudly, which startled me&mdash;but not as much as the inside of the room. I&rsquo;d known it would be small, but this was nothing more than a glorified closet. The top was open to the celling of the hallway, so the same low buzz and cold light was in this room, too. No shelves that I could see, but there was a toilet and sink. The main feature was a bed/cot sticking out of the wall, which Gary was currently stretched out on. He was on his stomach, one arm dangling off the side, and didn&rsquo;t seem to be doing&hellip; anything. I couldn&rsquo;t remember a time when I&rsquo;d seen Gary sitting completely still&mdash;he was always doing something&mdash;bouncing a leg, drumming his fingers against something, tapping a foot. Right now, though, he looked&hellip; well, lifeless. </p>
<p >Even so, a few seconds after I entered the room, Gary said groggily &ldquo;You&rsquo;re early,&rdquo; I blinked; <em>huh</em>? He turned onto his side, but in such a way that the arm dangling off the cot wasn&rsquo;t disturbed. Now that I looked at it more closely, I noticed there was some kind of a brace on his hand. Before I could say anything, Gary added absently &ldquo;And eager, too, judging by how loud you&rsquo;re being....&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Uh&hellip; early for&hellip; what?....&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s eyes flew open at the question, snapping to me immediately. A distant wail punctuated the momentary staring contest. </p>
<p >Gary grunted as he propped himself up with his good arm, swinging one leg off the cot to dangle above the floor. &ldquo;Meeting with my medication handler.&rdquo; His expression was far more resigned than I remembered it being. After a moment, he gestured with his left hand&mdash;the one with the brace&mdash;to the other end of his cot, saying somewhat hoarsely &ldquo;Please, sit! Make yourself comfortable. I&rsquo;d offer you a glass of water, but the only &lsquo;glass&rsquo; in here is my hands and....&rdquo; he gave an empty smile and pointed at his immobile hand, shrugging apologetically. </p>
<p >I took a deep breath before saying the words I&rsquo;d been trying not to think about for a month. &ldquo;I just want to know if you meant to k-kill Jimmy.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary didn&rsquo;t respond immediately, instead looking me up and down appraisingly. Eventually he sighed. &ldquo;If I answer you, you might just leave. How about you answer my question and then I answer yours?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I bristled. &ldquo;What? No, I don&rsquo;t wanna play any more games, Gary! Just answer the fucking question so I can go home.&rdquo; <em>Is it really home, though? Nobody at Bullworth cares about me.</em> </p>
<p >Gary narrowed his eyes, curling his lip up as he spoke. &ldquo;Really, Pete? I think answering one question is the <em>least</em> you can do as an apology for getting me locked up in this prison.&rdquo; He laughed hollowly, adding &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry! &lsquo;Recovery facility&rsquo;. Of course.&rdquo; </p>
<p >The two stared each other down for a while before I said, reluctantly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the question?&rdquo; I was curious about what Gary&rsquo;s question was, despite myself. </p>
<p >Gary simply said &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do it?&rdquo; He frowned at me, looking at me as if I were the most confusing thing in the world. &ldquo;You knew what I was going to do almost as soon as I did&mdash;and even then, you seemed to know exactly what to do to counter it.&rdquo; He crossed his legs in his patient&rsquo;s gown, leaning forward and finally looking like he was <em>alive</em> as he continued, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re smart, sure, but nobody&rsquo;s <em>that</em> smart.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I thought for a moment; <em>I guess it couldn&rsquo;t hurt to tell him, since the loop&rsquo;s resetting tonight.</em> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you do it before.&rdquo; At Gary&rsquo;s confusion, I said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain if you give me a satisfactory answer to my question.&rdquo; I then folded my arms and leaned against the corner the furthest from Gary and waited. </p>
<p >He glared for a bit, but relented. &ldquo;Fine. Hm. Did I mean to kill the moron....&rdquo; He tapped his chin for a moment before saying &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t planned on it beforehand. But you won&rsquo;t see me sending his whore of a mother flowers or anything.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes at my expression, saying &ldquo;Well what did you expect me to say about the death of one of the reasons I&mdash;&rdquo; he then cut himself off, wiping his face of all emotion and leaning back against the wall, avoiding looking at me. &ldquo;I regret what I did insofar as I&rsquo;m mad I got caught. I couldn&rsquo;t give less of a rat&rsquo;s ass about Jimmy Hopkins.&rdquo; He flicked his eyes back to me, and said impatiently &ldquo;Satisfied?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I had honestly not known what answer to expect&mdash;but now that I&rsquo;d heard it, it sounded so obvious. Of course Gary didn&rsquo;t care; why would he? He was a heartless asshole who didn&rsquo;t care about anybody but himself. I let out a breath of relief anyway. There was something&hellip; cathartic about knowing for sure, though. &ldquo;Sure, that works, I guess.&rdquo; Now that I had finished what I&rsquo;d set out to do, I relaxed, walking over to the cot and sitting down. &ldquo;So, um. When I say that I&rsquo;ve seen you do it before I mean that literally. Like, I&rsquo;ve seen these events play out twice before. Well, three times, now.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I turned to look at Gary, whose expression had gained a very surprised edge to it. &ldquo;<em>Really</em>, Petey? Are you sure we shouldn&rsquo;t be switching outfits?&rdquo; I rolled my eyes, especially as Gary added &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get too excited about getting to undress me, Femme Boy! It was a purely rhetorical question.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Even so, I gave Gary&rsquo;s question some real thought. <em>Still not sure if I&rsquo;m crazy or not.</em> &ldquo;Honestly?&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know; maybe? But the loop resets tonight, so oh well.&rdquo; I shrugged; it&rsquo;s not like I had to prove anything to Gary. I didn&rsquo;t owe him a thing. </p>
<p >Gary snorted, looking at me in disbelief. &ldquo;Wow, you really <em>do</em> believe that!&rdquo; He began bouncing his leg, scanning me up and down more closely. &ldquo;Tell me <strong>everything</strong>.&rdquo; </p>
<p >The intensity that Gary was scrutinizing me with made me squirm uncomfortably&mdash;it was like the attention of a whole crowd concentrated in one person. I got up, moving to go to the door &ldquo;Actually, I uh, think I s&ndash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >But Gary lunged forward, grabbing my arm. &ldquo;Wait, No! <em>Please</em>, I&ndash;&rdquo; He cut himself off again, swearing under his breath as if reprimanding himself for letting his guard down. Seemingly making an active effort to be quiet in contrast to his earlier almost-shout, he said in a shaky voice &ldquo;I-I won&rsquo;t stare.&rdquo; Letting go of my arm, he leaned back and added &ldquo;Promise. Just&hellip; continue.&rdquo; As if to prove that he was telling the truth, he squeezed his eyes shut. </p>
<p >I moved back to the cot and studied Gary, taking in just how vulnerable he looked. In the cold lighting and thin patient scrubs he looked deathly pale, especially since he wasn&rsquo;t wearing socks, for some reason. I grimaced at the way the band of his pants seemed to hang onto his hips with only two points of contact, he was so bony. <em>Is he always this thin?</em> Sure, I knew Gary was thin&mdash;I&rsquo;d lived with the guy for about two years now, after all&mdash;but this looked dangerous. He was shivering, like he&rsquo;d only just noticed how cold the room was, and he kept licking his lips nervously. It was such a departure from how I usually saw him; this was a far cry from the scheming teenager with more confidence than you could shake a stick at &lt;&gt;I remembered screaming at him beneath an overcast sky a month ago. It was weird. &ldquo;Sorry, you&rsquo;re, um&hellip; you can be a little intense.&rdquo; </p>
<p >As we spoke, Gary seemed to relax a little&mdash;as if the familiarity of listening to another person&rsquo;s speech and formulating a response was soothing. &ldquo;Heh, that&rsquo;s true. Now&hellip;&rdquo; He turned around so his back was flush to the wall, crossing his arms cross his chest even as he kept his eyes squeezed shut. Smirking a bit, he said &ldquo;So&hellip; if you&rsquo;ve seen me do this multiple times, does that mean you&rsquo;ve seen me win?&rdquo; I figured that meant he didn&rsquo;t believe my &lsquo;loop&rsquo; story, but wasn&rsquo;t going to comment on it. </p>
<p >I scratched the back of my head and replied &ldquo;Not really. Usually Jimmy goes head-to-head against you, though. This was the first time I confronted you directly.&rdquo; I snorted, rolled my eyes and added &ldquo;Never doing <em>that</em> again.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary frowned, seeming disappointed but merely let out a mild grunt. &ldquo;What else was different &lsquo;this time&rsquo;, then?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Getting to talk about the different timelines I&rsquo;d witnessed was such a rare experience, I couldn&rsquo;t help but keep talking. &ldquo;Well. Um&hellip; nobody&rsquo;s died before. Usually you two fall through the skylight in Crabblesnitch&rsquo;s office, not directly onto the roof.&rdquo; Gary nodded neutrally, gesturing for me to move on. I was grateful for the out. &ldquo;The, um, Lola thing was new.&rdquo; I coughed awkwardly, adding &ldquo;For me, anyway.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary full-on cackled at that. &ldquo;Oh yeah! Hehe, your expression that day in History was <em>priceless</em>!&rdquo; He snickered for a while, to my mild annoyance. <em>Yeah the time you manipulated somebody into seducing me was </em>hilarious<em>.</em> Eventually his laughter died down, and I noticed he&rsquo;d opened his eyes again. we sat in silence, and I started wondering if it was always this cold, and Gary staring blankly at one of the fluorescent bulbs that was flickering at irregular intervals. Eventually he snickered. &ldquo;I gotta admit Pete, you really threw me for a loop on that one. Fessing up to Johnny directly?&rdquo; He let out a whoosh of air, adding &ldquo;That move was so ballsy it actually hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> Huh. I think that&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever gotten a direct compliment from him. </em>  &ldquo;Uh. Thanks? I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it if I hadn&rsquo;t realized you were the reason she was doing it, though.&rdquo; A few seconds later I asked &ldquo;How, um&hellip; how <em>did</em> you get her to, uh, kiss me?&rdquo; Gary opened his mouth to answer, but he was still making a concerted effort to look off into the middle distance. &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t need to not look at me; it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; </p>
<p >He flicked his gaze over to me for a moment before shrugging and adjusting his position so he was facing me. In response to my question, he let out a raspberry. &ldquo;It really didn&rsquo;t take much. I just told her how to get you to like her.&rdquo; He shrugged, quirking one eyebrow up and adding &ldquo;Apparently, your butt is physically appealing enough to be referred to as a&rdquo; Here he grinned and used some exaggerated air quotes &ldquo; &lsquo;cutie-booty&rsquo;.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I blinked, simply saying &ldquo;Huh.&rdquo; I then looked down at my rear, baffled that anybody would even <em>notice</em> that part of my body. Gary, for his part, descended into a fit of giggles, and eventually I couldn&rsquo;t help but join in; I could hardly even remember the last time I&rsquo;d laughed. It&rsquo;d been&hellip; before Jimmy died, for sure. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> Oh&hellip; right; Gary&rsquo;s still a murderer&mdash;or at least complacent in murder. </em>  Soon silence returned, and I noted that the distant sounds took a sudden spike that sounded more like cheerful whoops and hollers than the usual screaming and wailing that this place called background noise. Suddenly, Gary piped up again, saying casually &ldquo;They have applications for non-family to visit, you know.&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t making eye-contact this time, and his fingers were digging into the cot. </p>
<p >I narrowed my eyes. <em>Is he&hellip; nervous? Like he seriously thinks I&rsquo;d consider seeing him regularly?</em> Eventually Gary did look at me, and I let the memory of Jimmy&rsquo;s dead body being hauled away in a body bag color my words with disgust. &ldquo;You just said you&rsquo;re not even sorry Jimmy&rsquo;s dead; why the hell would I want to <em>visit</em> you?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary just stared at me for a few seconds&mdash;not in surprise, but not a vacant stare, either. Eventually he looked away, gaze focused on the corner of the room and saying somewhat quietly &ldquo;Yeah, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to visit me either.&rdquo; And before I could even <em>begin</em> to understand what that meant, the sound of a lock being turned echoed down the hallway. Gary visibly tensed up, his hunched position quickly shifting to one of fearful readiness as he turned his head toward the sound. After a moment, he frowned, getting off the cot and saying &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s been nice catching up, but you should go.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I blinked, saying &ldquo;Wha&ndash;&rdquo; as Gary suddenly yanked me up and quickly walked me toward the door of the cell (which wasn&rsquo;t all that large to begin with). &ldquo;Bu&ndash;&rdquo; Gary clapped a hand over my mouth, frantically shaking his head. He opened the door and shoved me unceremoniously out just as the sound of the gate to the block opening could be heard. </p>
<p >Gary pointed down the hallway to the right as whoever it was said &ldquo;Hellooo, guess who?~&rdquo; their voice resonating strongly in the mostly concrete-and-tile corridor. As the footsteps tapped ever closer, Gary gestured even more emphatically this time&mdash;I got the hint. &ldquo;Time for your meds, crazy!&rdquo; I scrambled to my feet as Gary&rsquo;s cell door clicked softly shut, scampering down the passageway as fast as I could while still being quiet. </p>
<p >I made it just in time, too&mdash;an orderly rounded the corner, and sighed as he strolled up to Gary&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act like you can&rsquo;t hear me, kid.&rdquo; I leaned against the wall, catching my breath as I heard the orderly mess with something that sounded very much like keys before a lock turning could be heard. &lt;LOL LOCKS&gt; The conversation echoed quite audibly through the barred window in the door; even as I tried to catch my breath I could hear it fine. &ldquo;Alright, tonight you get to choose between a pill, a needle&hellip;&rdquo; here his voice gained an edge that set the hairs on my neck standing on end &ldquo;&hellip;and a little attention for this guy.&rdquo; The cot creaked as Gary, presumably, pretended to &lsquo;wake up&rsquo;. &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;ll it be, schitzoid?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary&rsquo;s voice sounded bored as he responded. &ldquo;I take it my advice paid off.&rdquo; There was a faint sound of rustling cloth and creaking bedsprings that only escalated my unease&mdash;but rather than pushing me to leave, it commanded that I stay. </p>
<p >The man, whoever he was, chuckled. &ldquo;Hehe, you got it, Smithy&mdash;Marcus is fucking <em>pissed</em>. Keeps insisting you can&rsquo;t use patients as con-consultants.... mmm....&rdquo; There was a slight rhythm to the squeaking of the springs, now. Bile was beginning to rise in my throat; <em>I have to do </em>something<em>!</em> But&hellip; what could I do? </p>
<p >I heard Gary snort, adding &ldquo;Oh, <em>that</em> asshole. Tell him that if you want something, you have to give something first.&rdquo; </p>
<p >The other person laughed breathlessly. &ldquo;Heh, I think you just like being my living cocksleeve....&rdquo; I was officially frozen in horror now. <em>What do I do what do I do what do I do!?</em> &ldquo;Mm yeah, you fucking slut; you were so desperate that first time yo&ndash;<em>fuuuuCK</em> yyesss ooh&rdquo; I squeezed my eyes shut but that didn&rsquo;t stop the sound of moans and slurps from reaching my ears. <em>God, get me OUT of here!</em> I was finally able to take a step away, which seemed to burst a dam because the next thing I knew I was pelting down the hall as fast as I could. Somebody shouted after me &ldquo;Hey! This is my round, asshole!&rdquo; but I didn&rsquo;t care. </p>
<p >I did a high-velocity reverse version of the method I&rsquo;d used to get there; through the gate, down the stairs, past guards complaining about the outcome of the game, out the window, across the yard, under the fence. I was sweating by the time I got out, but yanking the fake orderly shirt off and pulling my regular shirt over my head soon fixed that. Soon I was done, and I just sat, dazed, with my knees pulled up to my chest. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >I was amazed I managed to get back to the dorm without getting busted by any cops or prefects. The usual &ldquo;SKOOLZ OWT 4 EVAR&rdquo; banner greeted me, and the general din of happy teenage boys celebrating their impending freedom. <em>Not me, though.</em> I didn&rsquo;t find it difficult to head up the stairway, since nobody was paying me any mind. I shut the door to my dorm with a snap, taking a deep breath. When I opened my eyes, I scanned the room&mdash;like I had that first time through. </p>
<p >This time around both sides of the room looked pretty unlived in. I hadn&rsquo;t bothered to save most of my art this time around, or collect any cards. I did have a few things from Jimmy, but Gary&rsquo;s side was, again, as barren as&hellip; <em>As it will be when I wake up tomorrow.</em> I frowned, pushing off the door and wandering over to Gary&rsquo;s desk. I sat down in the folding-chair the school had provided and started opening drawers; cheap pens and binder paper were scattered randomly throughout the largest drawer, but none had anything written on them. Every other drawer was empty except one, which was chock-full of pill bottles&mdash;each one was full of pale tablets, some pale orange and some pink, but other than each label had the same text; </p>
<ol>
<li > SMITH: AMPHETAMINE SALT<br />1 BY MOUTH WITH EACH MEAL </li>
</ol>
<p >I stared at the drawer blankly for a while, the distant sounds of pranks being pulled in the main room of the dorm sounding in the background. I finally glanced over at Gary&rsquo;s bed, and I flashed on seeing Gary with his eyes squeezed shut, so desperate for some kind of interaction that he was trembling. Dropping the bottle back into the drawer, I breathed out&mdash;this changed everything. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> This was the single worst outcome I&rsquo;ve come to. </em>  I&rsquo;d felt bad about Gary being put in Happy Volts in the abstract sense before, but&hellip; the slurping noises made me shudder in disgust. <em>Jesus&hellip; I can&rsquo;t believe that&rsquo;s what we&mdash;no, </em><strong>I</strong>&mdash;<em>I&rsquo;ve been putting Gary through all this time.</em> I got up with a renewed sense of purpose, striding over to my wardrobe and changing into pajamas. <em>Gary may not be a good person, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he deserves that; I have the power to make sure he doesn&rsquo;t end up in there again, and that Jimmy is still alive. Next time, I&rsquo;ll make </em>sure<em> he takes his meds.</em> </p>
<p >Peter Kowalski snapped my lamp off at ten in the evening, Friday, June 1<sup>st</sup>. This time, I was going to get it <em>right</em>. </p>
<p >~~~Loop Four: ~~~ </p>
<p >I was feeling&hellip; relatively optimistic lately. It was just two loops after the one where Jimmy had died, and I&rsquo;d <em>finally</em> figured out how to get Gary to take his meds! The biting February cold had my nose itching something fierce as I walked back to school. I sighed, watching my breath float up as I reflected. It&rsquo;d been harder than usual to befriend Jimmy this time around, since I&rsquo;d needed to keep careful tabs on Gary&rsquo;s comings and goings. I&rsquo;d also not been able to stop the betrayal from happening&mdash;that had been&hellip; really disappointing, to say the least. Still, I <em>had</em> managed to keep Gary on his meds for a record amount of time, which was no small feat. I&rsquo;d especially been terrified when he&rsquo;d started deliberately skipping meals&mdash;luckily, it didn&rsquo;t seem like Gary&rsquo;d figured it out, since I was able to get him to eat again. </p>
<p >I frowned to myself as I passed the comic store; I was&hellip; pleased that Gary was taking his medication&mdash;he clearly needed it, after all&mdash;but&hellip; it didn&rsquo;t seem like all that much about this loop was <em>different</em>. Pondering the dark waters of Bullworth Harbor, the only difference seemed to be the pace at which things were happening&mdash;Jimmy usually would&rsquo;ve been in the middle of dealing with the Greasers by now, but this time around he was only finishing up with the Preppies. And I had expected there to not be a reason to deal with them at all&mdash;after all, if Gary wasn&rsquo;t planning anything, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a reason for all the cliques to hate Jimmy, right? </p>
<p >I nodded to a prefect as I passed under the stone gates of the school, continuing my train of thought. Then there was the matter of how&hellip; <em>wrong</em> it felt to force Gary to take his meds. I had tried to rationalize it by figuring it probably wouldn&rsquo;t work, but this was working much better than everything else I&rsquo;d tried. It was the largest contributing factor to this sense of dread that I couldn&rsquo;t shake, even though things were going quite well&mdash;Gary was following the same plan that he had when he didn&rsquo;t know about my involvement, which meant he probably didn&rsquo;t know about my helping Jimmy. But on the other hand, he wasn&rsquo;t talking as freely to me anymore. In the loops were Gary didn&rsquo;t know about my helping Jimmy, Gary would talk pretty freely about his plans in our room, bouncing ideas off of me in-between the verbal abuse. But recently, Gary had become pretty closed off, though I thought it was possible that was because he was taking his meds now. Either way, I stomped my boots after finally entering the Boy&rsquo;s dorm, pulling my gloves off and rubbing my hands together to get the blood flowing. <em>Well, it&rsquo;s only February&mdash;I&rsquo;ve still got a lot of time.</em> I glanced at my watch as I ascended the stairs; it was nearly nine. <em>God, I am tired&hellip; How does Gary do this manipulation and lying thing so much? It&rsquo;s exhausting&hellip;</em> Finally entering my dorm room, I gave a distracted &ldquo;Hey, Gary&rdquo; before plopping onto my bed and pulling out my sketchbook. I started doodling whatever&mdash;hands holding things, a lab coat, some pill bottles&hellip; After a while, though, I felt somebody&rsquo;s eyes on me. Looking up, it turned out Gary was staring at me intently. He didn&rsquo;t look overtly hostile&mdash;more like he was&hellip; <em>examining</em> me. I replied before I was able to formulate a proper response. &ldquo;&hellip;Um, what? Do you want something?&rdquo; I flinched. <em>Well, I could&rsquo;ve phrased </em>that<em> better.</em> </p>
<p >Gary narrowed his eyes at that. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Petey, you tell me. What <em>do</em> I want?&rdquo; He leaned toward me as if listening for something. I raised my eyebrows&mdash;<em>this is new&hellip;</em> That made me swallow nervously. </p>
<p >I tried to read Gary&rsquo;s expression, but his face was very blank. <em>Better tread carefully.</em> I replied slowly &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Gary; I&rsquo;m not a mind reader.&rdquo; Frowned, I added &ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo; </p>
<p >That made Gary laugh&mdash;though it didn&rsquo;t sound happy. He added &ldquo;Puh-<em>lease</em>, Femme Boy! Like you don&rsquo;t fucking <em>know</em>,&rdquo; before glaring at me for a bit. I blinked&mdash;<em>what is he talking about? He&hellip; he couldn&rsquo;t </em>know,<em> could</em> <em>he?</em> After a while, Gary grinned and added, &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s got something to do with the fact that I haven&rsquo;t eaten for four fucking days, hm?&rdquo; my eyes widened at that. <em>Oh my God!</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;Wha, four days!? Why would you&ndash;&rdquo; I was cut off by a pillow suddenly hitting me in the face. </p>
<p >&ldquo;DON&rsquo;T <em>lie</em>, Pete!&rdquo; Gary hissed &ldquo;You know <em>exactly</em> why!&rdquo; He slipped off his bed and began to pace back and forth across the room, holding my gaze the entire time. I gulped nervously. <em>Come on, there&rsquo;s no way knows!</em> But I gave my full attention to Gary as he asked quietly &ldquo;You were trying to fucking <em>fix</em> me, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Gary kept pacing, but my gaze was suddenly drawn inexorably to the floor. &nbsp;<em>Shitshitshitshit, he</em> knows. </p>
<p >I wasn&rsquo;t even aware of opening my mouth, but I still heard my voice answering Gary&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; But Gary interrupted with an empty laugh. </p>
<p >&ldquo;You know <em>exactly</em> what I&rsquo;m talking about, Kowalski!&rdquo; he hissed, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t deny it. You&rsquo;re fucking <em>drugging</em> me, little Femme Boy.&rdquo; I squeezed my eyes shut, feeling all the guilt I&rsquo;d been able to keep at bay until now crashing down around me. I heard Gary adopt one of his favored high-pitched, mock-girly tones for when he really wanted to make me feel like crap. &ldquo;Oooh, look at me, I&rsquo;m Peter Kowalski, I&rsquo;m the only sane motherfucker in this hell-hole! Oooh, my poor roommate is so <em>crazy</em>!&rdquo; my eyes snapped open at the sound of books hitting objects in the room, but Gary didn&rsquo;t seem to care about that&mdash;he looked&hellip; angry, of course, but there was something far more painful underneath the rage. His voice increased in volume, shouts punctuated by screams &ldquo;Ooh, let&rsquo;s try and <em>help</em> him, surely the right <em>chemicals</em> will solve the problem!&rdquo; <em>I didn&rsquo;t mean it like </em>that<em>!</em> </p>
<p >I straightened a little, interrupting Gary&rsquo;s rant. &ldquo;No, I never thou&ndash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >But he whirled around and cut me off. &ldquo;SAVE it, Kowalski. I know you. You think you&rsquo;re better than me, huh?&rdquo; He tilted his head as if to ask <em>well?</em> before hissing &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re <em>not</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I bristled a little at that. &ldquo;I do <em>not</em> think I&rsquo;m smarter than yo&ndash;&rdquo; But Gary interrupted me again, this time looking like he was trying to crush his own forehead. </p>
<p >&ldquo;CRIST, Pete! I don&rsquo;t mean intelligence! I mean you think you&rsquo;re a better <em>person</em> than me! &nbsp;<em>Don&rsquo;t</em> you?&rdquo; </p>
<p >For a second, I could&rsquo;ve sworn I heard the echo of the very same person praising me for my kindness in comparison to my peers. I shook my head, stammering out &ldquo;&hellip;I&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never reall&ndash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Bull. FUCKING. Shit, Pete.&rdquo; I snapped back to the present to see Gary grinning as he affected a casual air, as if we were discussing the weather. &ldquo;I bet you think you&rsquo;re a good person, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t say anything, worrying my lip as I considered. <em>Do I?</em> Gary chuckled and resumed his pacing. &ldquo;You see Pete; you <em>think</em> that you&rsquo;re doing the right thing. You think that there&rsquo;s something <em>broken</em> about me, that if you just adjust this brain chemical or that hormone I&rsquo;ll be <em>fixed.</em>&rdquo; Each point Gary made drove the guilt-knife in deeper&mdash;these were the exact questions I had been taking great pains to avoid. Gary turned and smirked at me before shrugging. &ldquo;But you know what? I&rsquo;m <em>NOT</em> broken!&rdquo; He stalked over to his desk, pulling one of the drawers open and, carrying it over to his bed, turned it upside down, spilling all the bottles of pills that I had been quietly accessing over the semester. Gary&rsquo;s face seemed to freeze at the large number of the small bottles&mdash;my chest felt suddenly much tighter when I noticed the slight <em>fear</em> in Gary&rsquo;s face before it morphed into disgust. &ldquo;See, all these&hellip; chemicals?&rdquo; He paused to re-established eye-contact and drop the drawer onto the floor before continuing. &ldquo;They were holding me back, Pete. <em>THAT&rsquo;S</em> why I stopped taking my meds.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I looked from Gary&rsquo;s face to the small mountain of bottles on the bed before remembering the frankly <em>insane</em> amount of research into medicine I&rsquo;d done in previous loops. Frowning, I was about to explain that all the research said he <em>needed</em> the medication, but Gary beat me to it. &ldquo;Oh, but I can hear you wine, Femme Boy &lsquo;but Gaaary you neeeed the meds! They make you better!&rsquo; <strong>FUCK</strong> YOU!&rdquo; I jumped, partly at the sound, but mostly at the <em>rage</em> behind Gary&rsquo;s scream&mdash;<em>have I ever seen Gary lose his cool like this?</em> I wracked my brain; but in all the years I&rsquo;d been living in the same town as and attending school with Gary, I had never seen him get this upset. Even when I had seen Gary in moments of weakness like in the asylum, it was different&mdash;there, he had been beaten down by a month of misery, as if he&rsquo;d accepted his lot. But here he still had something to prove. Gary seemed to realize that he&rsquo;d lost it a little, because he took a couple of deep breaths before continuing in a deceptively calm voice. </p>
<p >&ldquo;&hellip;you don&rsquo;t know shit, Kowalski. In fact, you know even less than the stupid therapists that say I need those pills. They don&rsquo;t give a shit about what I think about my meds. They&rsquo;re getting paid, why should they? But you&hellip; you think you&rsquo;re some fucking hero. You think you&rsquo;re gonna be like&hellip; Hopkins? Come in and save the day? Well guess what? You&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s doing this for &lsquo;my own good&rsquo;. But you&rsquo;ve never even asked me about this shit. You and my therapists are in the same boat, except <em>you</em> think you&rsquo;re better than them because you <em>claim</em> to care about my wellbeing. But you&rsquo;re using me, just like they are! Oh, you can <em>tell</em> me it&rsquo;s different, but it aaaall comes down to the same thing; doctors want money, so they diagnose kids with &lsquo;mental problems&rsquo; and give them drugs that shut them up and make their parents happy. &lsquo;Heroes&rsquo; want other people to tell them what a &lsquo;difference in their lives you&rsquo;ve made&rsquo; or &lsquo;how much you&rsquo;ve helped this community&rsquo;. Well guess what, <em>loser</em>? You haven&rsquo;t done a goddamn thing that&rsquo;s at all noteworthy. You keep your nose clean, and everybody at this school basically ignores you. Ha! But do you <em>honestly</em> think <em>that</em> makes you a good person? Think again. It&rsquo;s sink or swim, Kowalski; &nbsp;and you&rsquo;re just as alone as everybody else.&rdquo; </p>
<p >And with that, Gary slammed the door shut behind him hard enough to make the pile of pill bottles shift and spill onto the floor; I flinched. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >I spent the next few months avoiding Gary. What could I say to that? I hardly knew what to <em>think</em> about what Gary had said, much less how to talk to him about it. Luckily (<em>well&hellip; sort of</em>), he had entered his &lsquo;never leave the dorm room&rsquo; level of planning, so I didn&rsquo;t have to try all that hard to avoid him. </p>
<p >Of course, as Gary sunk deeper and deeper into his plans, Jimmy&rsquo;s success and ego only grew. It seemed like the less credit for helping I took, the more likely it was that Jimmy would get a big head about it; so now I didn&rsquo;t even have the illusion of a friend anymore. <em>Jimmy&rsquo;s probably going to get expelled today, certainly by tomorrow.</em> I quietly marveled at the extreme lack of distress this thought brought me as I set my books down in Chemistry. <em>I guess Jimmy getting expelled is just&hellip; something that happens, from my perspective.</em> I sighed&mdash;more proof that Gary was right about me &lsquo;letting the losers drown&rsquo;. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> Just in general, though&mdash;it&rsquo;s not like I don&rsquo;t  </em> care<em> about Jimmy, it&rsquo;s just&hellip; something that needs to happen</em>. I knew justifying myself was a fool&rsquo;s errand but it made me feel a little better. Even so, a small voice in the back of my mind whispered <em>you&rsquo;ve been spending all your time trying to figure out Gary&rsquo;s deal so you haven&rsquo;t found out how to keep Jimmy from that spray-paint idiocy. </em>My moody thoughts were interrupted by the professor cheerfully telling everybody to grab a table, and informing them to follow his instructions precisely, since they would be working with volatile chemicals today. Additionally, it was a group-lab day, something only higher level science courses had, as I had been slowly but surely finding out. Today I was with Melvin and Cornelius; the two Nerds were having a heated argument that distracted me from my own depressing thoughts. Melvin was hissing &ldquo;Of course she wouldn&rsquo;t! That would be <em>completely</em> out of character for her!&rdquo; </p>
<p >The friends sat on the other side of the small table from me, and as I measured out the amount of liquids they&rsquo;d need for the period, Cornelius replied in a confused tone &ldquo;But it would be walking right into GraveWing&rsquo;s trap! Samantha the Bold wouldn&rsquo;t walk into a trap if she could help it, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p >As I copied down the formulas they were supposed to be working on for the period, I considered the ridiculous names in Cornelius&rsquo; sentence. <em>Must be about one of those Grottos and Gremlins games the Nerds like so much.</em> Melvin groaned in frustration. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the <em>point</em>, she <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> know!&rdquo; When the teacher shushed him, the passionate gamer lowered his voice to a hiss that was easily covered up by my Bunsen-burning to sterilize our materials. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the &lsquo;RP&rsquo; in &lsquo;RPG&rsquo; <em>means</em>!&rdquo; </p>
<p >Cornelius gave his friend a skeptical look, replying to him in a tone that clearly suggested he was bonkers. &ldquo;So&hellip; you&rsquo;re saying I&rsquo;m supposed to just&hellip; walk into something I know is a trap? Even though I <em>heard</em> Beatrice set it up yesterday?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Melvin gestured frantically, as if he wasn&rsquo;t sure what gesture to even make. &ldquo;YES! That is <em>exactly</em> what I&rsquo;m saying! Samantha <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> where GraveWing was, so she <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> know!!&rdquo; </p>
<p >Cornelius&rsquo;s skeptical expression deepened to incredulity. &ldquo;&hellip;and you say that anime is silly. Willingly walk into a trap? Come on, Mel, that&rsquo;s the most ridiculous thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&rdquo; I glanced up from my finished preparations, looking between the two other boys at the table. <em>Wait&hellip; does Cornelius not play Grottos and Gremlins?</em> Melvin, frustrated, seemed give up on his friend&rsquo;s seeming inability to grasp such a simple concept, crossing his arms and leaning down to inspect my work in a huff. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Sorry, I don&rsquo;t mean to butt in&hellip;&rdquo; both boys looked up at my comment. &ldquo;&hellip;but, um, Cornelius, do you not play GnG?&rdquo; Surprise turned to indignation on Melvin&rsquo;s part, and annoyance on Cornelius&rsquo;s. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Not <em>all</em> of us Nerds play GnG, you know.&rdquo; Melvin replied, icily, before his tone turned teasing. &ldquo;Some of us choose to spend all our time watching kid&rsquo;s cartoons and writing fanfiction, isn&rsquo;t that right, Cornelius?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He punched Melvin in the arm, saying &ldquo;Like role playing&rsquo;s any different, Mel!&rdquo; Even so, both were smiling before they were silenced by the teacher&rsquo;s scolding. </p>
<p >I, meanwhile, had realized something&mdash;I had been attending school with these two for about three continuous years, and yet I&rsquo;d never even thought that they might have different interests from one another. As the class continued, I thought back to that second time I&rsquo;d attended Chemistry with Jimmy. During a couple of loops Jimmy had even tried to tutor me in the subject, but it hadn&rsquo;t really gone well&mdash;Jimmy&rsquo;s thought process was just too different from mine. I felt myself smile as I remembered Jimmy trying to explain the difference between &lsquo;square&rsquo; and &lsquo;circle&rsquo; tubes before he&rsquo;d got fed up, sweeping all that they&rsquo;d been working on off the desk and dragging us to the movies instead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be way more fun than beating your head against a wall, man; promise.&rdquo; Watching Cornelius carefully mix in the iodine (not too much&mdash;then they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see anything), I considered the many memories of Jimmy I had like that&mdash;where they were just hanging out and shooting the shit. And as my thoughts had been want to do lately, I started thinking about Gary. But I frowned when I tried to call up a happy, relaxed memory of Gary that didn&rsquo;t have an undercurrent of fear or anxiety. There weren&rsquo;t many; and most were from before the loops, the occasional times Gary and I had met during childhood. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> &hellip;Hey, maybe that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m missing? </em>  Now that I thought about it, I didn&rsquo;t really <em>know</em> Gary all that well as a person&mdash;not like I did with Jimmy.&lt;&gt; <em>Maybe&hellip; maybe he just needs friends? </em>Real <em>friends!</em> The idea felt so natural that I wondered why I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it before. I felt my smile widen as I let the thought of having <em>another</em> friend lift my mood higher than it had been in months; all the manipulation, the lying, and the deception, I didn&rsquo;t have to do any of it anymore! I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy, but hell, something that just <em>felt</em> this right was bound to be worth it.  </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >Loop Twenty Three: Help Pete </p>
<p >I dragged myself into the common room and collapsed onto the couch, wishing quite desperately that workouts carried over between the loops too. If I could, I would&rsquo;ve stayed over by the gym and just sketched until my muscles had relaxed a bit, but then I would&rsquo;ve thrown off the whole schedule. </p>
<p >As I pulled out my sketchbook, I heard Gary enter the room with a &ldquo;Good evening, young lady! And what&rsquo;re we watching today?&rdquo; <em>Here goes nothing&mdash;c&rsquo;mon, Pete, deep breath.</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;Hey Gary&mdash;not watching anything, just sitting. Gym was exhausting.&rdquo; I carefully watched Gary vault over the couch and plop down while he was talking. It&rsquo;d been five whole loops since Gary&rsquo;d given me a serious reality check&mdash;befriending him had proved to be far easier said than done, unsurprisingly. </p>
<p >To my surprise, Gary leaned up against me and threw his legs over the left side of the couch so he was stretched out. He even responded to my comment with &ldquo;Mm, gym class isn&rsquo;t kind to those of us with more intellectual leanings, is it?&rdquo; <em>Huh! That&rsquo;s new!</em> Usually, Gary would comment on how I was &lsquo;responding to &lsquo;young lady&rsquo; now&rsquo; and prop his feet on the sketchbook instead of the couch. I smiled to myself. <em>Guess I&rsquo;m doing </em>some<em>thing right.</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; While it was a marked improvement, it did make it kind of hard to draw. &ldquo;Sorry, could you move a little? I can&rsquo;t really draw with you leaning on me like that.&rdquo; Gary turned to me sporting an unhappy frown&mdash;the &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like how you&rsquo;re acting like you&rsquo;ve got a say in what I do&rsquo; frown, as I had dubbed it. It usually preceded Gary doing something weird. My smile disappeared and I gulped a little. <em>Oh man&hellip;</em> </p>
<p >Curling the frown up into a smirk, Gary replied &ldquo;Oh, certainly, Petey!&rdquo; before smoothly swinging his legs around to prop them on the <em>other</em> side of the couch&mdash;which put his legs in my lap. </p>
<p >Gary looked very satisfied with his misinterpretation of my words; but I just rolled my eyes and snorted a little. &ldquo;Heh, fair enough.&rdquo; I extracted my sketchbook from under Gary&rsquo;s legs, placing it on top like a table. &ldquo;That okay?&rdquo; Gary narrowed his eyes in thought, a classic &lsquo;wait that&rsquo;s not Petey behavior&rsquo; look before shrugging and letting his head fall back so he was looking up at the ceiling. I smiled. &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; This was new, too. The next few minutes were spent in surprisingly cordial silence as I tried sketching Gary&rsquo;s pose and expression at the moment&mdash;If I was able to capture stuff on paper, I had found that it tended to stick in my brain longer so I could actually remember it. Not to mention it made me feel like I understood it better. I snorted to myself. <em>Yeah, like I understand Gary at all.</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;Wow, Pete, are you really <em>that</em> enamored of me?&rdquo; I started a little, glancing over to find Gary had lifted himself up onto his hands and was peering at the drawing currently propped on his legs. &ldquo;And here I thought you and the new kid were in love!&rdquo; I rolled my eyes despite my rueful smile as Gary let out a mock-disappointed tsk. &ldquo;Oh Femme Boy, you&rsquo;re such a creature of passion.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I full-on laughed at that. &ldquo;Come on, Gary, me and <em>Jimmy?</em> Yeah, right.&rdquo; I shook my head, snickering. Gary suddenly swung his legs off my lap, sending the sketchbook careening to the floor. <em>Well, that was bound to happen sooner or later anyway.</em> </p>
<p >Propping his arm on the back of the couch, Gary made friendly-seeming eye-contact with me, though I knew Gary well enough to know that that there was probably more to it than that. &ldquo;You two do seem to have quite the rapport, though, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Then he paused, looking at me askance. I braced myself. <em>Here we go.</em> &ldquo;Well&hellip; mostly. I mean, I doubt somebody who was <em>my</em> friend would just leave me after I&rsquo;d been knocked to the ground.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Well, I only met him two days ago.&rdquo; I shrugged. What was strange about Gary (well&hellip; one of the things) was how he could never just get to the point. He insists on winding his way obliquely toward what he wanted to say, and he hated whenever somebody took control of a conversation. So I had to wait for Gary to propose his idea in order to agree to it. </p>
<p >Gary sighed, and shook his head as if I were being extremely na&iuml;ve. &ldquo;Poor, sweet, innocent Petey. Are you telling me you think <em>Jimmy Hopkins</em> is a good person?&rdquo; And he gave me his most patronizing look. </p>
<p >I gave it some thought for a moment before replying. &ldquo;No, Jimmy isn&rsquo;t a good person, but he&rsquo;s not a bad person either.&rdquo; I shrugged somewhat apologetically, giving a lop-sided smile. &ldquo;I mean, he&rsquo;s only fifteen&mdash;he&rsquo;s got a lot of growing up to do.&rdquo; <em>It&rsquo;s true, after all. Technically I&rsquo;m a lot older than Jimmy but I still have a lot of stuff to learn.</em> </p>
<p >Gary snorted, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s true, how do you explain yourself, Femme Boy?&rdquo; He gave me a smug smile, smirking like he&rsquo;d already &lsquo;won&rsquo; the &lsquo;argument&rsquo;. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> Here we go&mdash;just play along, he&rsquo;ll get there eventually. </em>  &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; And Gary gave me the whole spiel about how <em>nice</em> I was. I watched Gary&rsquo;s expression carefully. <em>Does he really believe I can help?</em> </p>
<p >Finally, Gary reached the end of his list, and looked back at me with a pleasant smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re practically a <em>saint</em> by Bullworth standards!&rdquo; I nodded slowly. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><em> Okay, let&rsquo;s lead him to the point. </em>  &ldquo;Well&hellip; um, thank you. But what&rsquo;s that got to do with Jimmy?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary positively beamed. &ldquo;Now <em>that</em> is an excellent question!&rdquo; Removing his elbow from the back of the couch, he started scooching closer to me with the now-familiar glint of&hellip; something in his eye. I still wasn&rsquo;t totally sure what it was. &ldquo;You see, Petey, this entire school is <em>full</em> of people like Jimmy-boy, right?&rdquo; I nodded, subtly trying to increase the distance between the two of them&mdash;Gary didn&rsquo;t seem to have a firm grasp on the concept of &lsquo;personal space&rsquo;. Luckily, he was too busy grinning at my agreement with his statement to notice. &ldquo;Exactly! They&rsquo;re the reason people at this school are fighting all the time&mdash;&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s expression, to my surprise, shifted to sympathetic. &ldquo;&mdash;the reason people aren&rsquo;t talking to you, Femme Boy.&rdquo; I squirmed a bit at that, looking down at my hands; that hit home. I&rsquo;d mostly learned to accept how little attention people paid me, but&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t deny that it wasn&rsquo;t easy only having one, possibly two, friends. &ldquo;Just imagine being able to get Jimmy-boy to, ahem, convince people to see things <em>your</em> way!&rdquo; I looked back up at Gary&rsquo;s face and flinched back a little&mdash;he&rsquo;d leaned forward again, and his face had taken on a more far-away look, with a slightly crazed grin. <em>He&rsquo;s thinking about the plan&mdash;his mask is slipping a bit.</em> I breathed a bit&mdash;this part wasn&rsquo;t as scary now that I knew Gary better. I frowned, though. <em>Why can&rsquo;t he just be honest?</em> </p>
<p >I replied carefully &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Gary gave his head a little shake before re-focusing after my comment, after which I continued with &ldquo;I think you should ask for Jimmy&rsquo;s opinion about all this before you assume he&rsquo;ll beat people up, but&hellip;&rdquo; I took a deep breath, steeling myself. <em>Here goes nothing!</em> &ldquo;I want to help you. So&hellip; count me in.&rdquo; I gave Gary the most determined-looking smile I could. It was the truth&mdash;if I couldn&rsquo;t understand the plan from the outside looking in, being an active part of it might let me better understand both the plan and its creator&rsquo;s mind. </p>
<p >Gary&rsquo;s face was blank with surprise for a moment before he slowly returned my smile, skootching back and holding out a hand for a handshake. &ldquo;Well, then, Petey&mdash;looks like we&rsquo;ve got ourselves a deal!&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s grip reminded me a lot of the bank teller that had shaken my hand when my parents took me to open a checking account&mdash;very professional, no personal connotations. I sighed a little. <em>Ah, well; I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be </em>that<em> easy, getting Gary Smith to be my friend.</em> </p>
<p >While shaking my hand, Gary turned toward the entryway to the common room. &ldquo;Hey man, what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on?&rdquo; Pulling my hand easily from Gary&rsquo;s grasp, I waved happily to Jimmy. Jimmy really <em>was</em> the polar opposite of Gary&mdash;he was so easy to get to know, offering up information about himself without the complex social and psychological gymnastics necessary with Gary. </p>
<p >Jimmy half-smiled, nodding in my direction before shrugging and replying to Gary&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;Not much.&rdquo; Now was the point where things got pretty familiar. </p>
<p >Gary didn&rsquo;t respond to Jimmy&rsquo;s comment, since he was clearly itching to talk. &ldquo;I was just telling Petey here about my idea to take over the school&mdash;&rdquo; I had to suppress a snort at Gary correcting himself; he really could be obvious at times. To cover it up I nodded solemnly. &ldquo;&mdash;I mean my plan for <em>us</em> to take over the school.&rdquo; But, thinking about it, I found myself feeling rather sad about Gary&rsquo;s slip-up. </p>
<p >&ldquo;What <em>plan</em>?&rdquo; <em>Does he really not even consider us a part of it? Why include us if that&rsquo;s the case?</em> </p>
<p >I automatically turned toward Gary for this part; it was pretty central to understanding him, after all. He waved a hand as if to dismiss Jimmy&rsquo;s concerns as he gave him a reassuring smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Jimmy! It&rsquo;s just a little something I came up with.&rdquo; Crossing his arms on the back of the couch, his smile morphed into something closer to a smirk as he launched into his spiel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sink or swim, my friend. And if you&rsquo;re good at swimming&mdash;&rdquo; Here he looked over at me as usual. But to my surprise, Gary didn&rsquo;t have the usual condescension written in his expression. Or at least, not as much of it. I would&rsquo;ve called it &lsquo;sad&rsquo; if I hadn&rsquo;t known any better. &ldquo;&mdash;you gotta let the losers drown.&rdquo; Gary flicked his gaze away from me at that and into a corner of the room, looking pensive for a moment before lifting his hand as usual and adding &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you guys leave the thinking up to me?&rdquo; as he got off the couch and began walking toward the window, re-establishing the usual cadence of the conversation. </p>
<p >But I stared off into space, thinking about what had just been said. <em>Wow, that&rsquo;s the most sympathy from this scene that I&rsquo;ve ever seen from Gary. It&rsquo;s gotta be because I agreed to his plan so easily. But he still said to leave the thinking up to him&ndash; </em>&ldquo;&ndash;Petey, you were right. Jimmy <em>is</em> pretty dumb.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I blinked and looked up at being addressed, but turned my head in Jimmy&rsquo;s direction at &ldquo;<em>What</em>&rsquo;d you say about me!?&rdquo; <em>Oh, dang&mdash;forgot about this bit.</em> </p>
<p >I turned to face Jimmy for this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, I don&rsquo;t remember saying that&mdash;if I did, I&rsquo;m sorry, though.&rdquo; Jimmy didn&rsquo;t look entirely satisfied by that apology, but he didn&rsquo;t look like he wanted to give me an Indian burn anymore, either. So I shifted my focus to Gary. &ldquo;But about what Jimmy said, I actually have a question&mdash;why <em>should</em> you do all the thinking?&rdquo; Gary looked momentarily startled at my question before his eyes narrowed in hostility. I gulped. <em>Oh boy, here we go&hellip;</em> </p>
<p >&ldquo;Well, Petey, I&rsquo;m the one who thought of the plan&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it make sense that I&rsquo;m the one running things?&rdquo; As he spoke, Gary rose from his seat to stand casually looking down his nose at me as he addressed me. <em>Like a king to his peons. Real subtle, Gary.</em> I tried to ignore the fact that it actually was a little intimidating. </p>
<p >I rose to my feet as well, nodding in agreement as I tried to put my thoughts in order. &ldquo;Yeah, it makes perfect sense&mdash;but just because you&rsquo;re in charge doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to think everything up by yourself, you know?&rdquo; Gary curled his lip up at that; never a good sign. <em>Oh crap&mdash;I guess I touched a nerve</em>. </p>
<p >Gary stepped closer to me, staring into my eyes intently with a sneer on his face. Forget &lsquo;a little&rsquo;&mdash;that was <em>very</em> intimidating. After a moment of Gary looking me over, though, he stepped back a bit and smirked, adding &ldquo;Oh, I get it, Femme Boy.&rdquo; Instead of looking at me like I was something disgusting on the bottom of his shoe, now Gary was looking at me like I was an amusing child. &ldquo;You think <em>you</em> should do the thinking, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I blinked. <em>What the hell kind of logical leap was that?</em> I shook my head, adding &ldquo;Wha-? No, that wasn&rsquo;t what I&mdash;&rdquo; But, unsurprisingly, Gary didn&rsquo;t let me finish. </p>
<p >Gary kept his tone casual, as if he were just giving friendly advice. &ldquo;Hey, now Petey; don&rsquo;t <em>lie!</em>&rdquo; my eyes widened. <em>Oh, <strong>fuck</strong>!</em> So far, <em>this</em> particular outcome hadn&rsquo;t repeated itself, oddly enough. I wasn&rsquo;t sure why or how, if I was honest&mdash;but despite the memory of that first time through becoming blurry as time passed, the fear of that abuse had lingered. More than the increasing violence he displayed, more than the hatred he displayed toward Jimmy, the memory of Gary hurting me so badly for seemingly no reason and then laughed at me for crying about it had been what kept me from trusting Gary.&lt;&gt; Before that, I had thought of them being friendly with one another&mdash;not great friends, but definitely friendly. While I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time, that was what soured the relationship; after that, I felt like I was trapped, stuck with Gary of no volition of my own. </p>
<p >Back in the present, I took a quick step back, looking over at Jimmy, imploring him to do <em>something</em>. &ldquo;Come on, Gary, I&rsquo;m not ly&ndash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;&lsquo;Cuz you know what we do to liars around here, right?&rdquo; I swallowed nervously, studying Gary&rsquo;s face carefully. He looked much angrier than he had the first time. </p>
<p >I contemplated Gary in the few moments before the inevitable groin attack, and started when a thought struck me; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re <em>scared</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary didn&rsquo;t seem to hear me. &ldquo;We kick them in the <strong>balls</strong>!&rdquo; I honestly thought it hurt more this time, since I&rsquo;d been expecting it. <em>At least I was able to collapse directly onto the couch.</em> </p>
<p >Through the haze of pain, I managed to hear Gary give a disgusted snort before turning away and talking to Jimmy about his new slingshot. As Gary kept talking, though, I heard Jimmy quietly say to me &ldquo;Uh&hellip; hey, just&hellip; lie on your back and get some water, &lsquo;kay, man?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I was impressed with myself that I managed to squeak out a &ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; before giving in to the pain. A few people came up to me and laughed at how immobilized with pain I was. But the sudden onslaught of uncontrollable sobbing was severe enough that they actually left me alone. </p>
<p >God<em>damnit</em>&hellip; EVERYTHING I&rsquo;d worked so hard for was just so <em>stupid</em>! What, did I think I could be <em>friends</em> with Gary fucking Smith? The same kid who&rsquo;d spent the last fifteen years of his life calling me &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo; and doing nothing but belittle me and spent more time locked in his own head thinking than he did sleeping? Ha&hellip; yeah right. All I had was the begrudging friendship of somebody who, from his perspective, I&rsquo;d met <em>two days ago</em> because he didn&rsquo;t share any of my memories of studying together and hanging out together and dolling out unsolicited advice on girls. I buried my head in my arms as the emptiness in my chest felt like it was swallowing me whole; I was truly, utterly, <em>alone</em>. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >I had lost track of how long I&rsquo;d been lying on the couch, but eventually I heard Gary sneering behind me. &ldquo;Oh, <em>there</em> you are, Femme Boy. I&rsquo;d almost <em>forgotten</em> about you!&rdquo; That sent a fresh wave of sickening loneliness through my gut. I&rsquo;d stopped bothering to hide my tear-streaked face in my arms from whoever happened to be around. when Gary knelt down in front of my face so they were somewhat eye-to-eye, though, my overwhelming apathy changed to mild surprise. Gary was sporting a supremely pissed-off expression. <em>At least he&rsquo;s not laughing like the first time....</em> I would&rsquo;ve felt scared, but I honestly didn&rsquo;t care anymore. Gary contemplated my sorry state of misery for a bit before giving me a look that clearly stated I deserved this. &ldquo;Now, Femme Boy; I hope we&rsquo;ve learned a valuable lesson today.&rdquo; He leaned forward, hissing right in my face &ldquo;Do<em> not</em> try to undermine my authority. Got it?&rdquo; He kept his face close to mine, waiting for an answer. my jaw, meanwhile, would have fallen off if I hadn&rsquo;t been lying on a couch. <em>What!?</em> I pushed myself up, trying to think about what Gary could mean by <em>that</em>. Eyes widening as it all clicked, I realized what was going on in Gary&rsquo;s head&mdash;<em>it&rsquo;s the same thing he does to Jimmy in the Hole!</em> I groaned, slapping myself in the face. Of <em>course</em> Gary was scared; if he actually thought that I was valuable, he&rsquo;d assume I would want all the power for myself. I laughed a little to myself. How could I be so <em>blind</em> as to miss that? I couldn&rsquo;t see him with my hand still covering my face, but I could hear Gary growling &ldquo;Is that a yes? Because I&rsquo;m going to be very angry if it&rsquo;s not, Petey.&rdquo; Removing my hand from my face, I decided to try something I&rsquo;d never done before. </p>
<p >Taking a deep breath, I began reciting. &ldquo;I know you hate me, Jimmy-boy. I know you said all that stuff about me behind me back.&rdquo; I kept my voice neutral, rather than trying to emulate the loathing and disgust that Gary injected into those words. &ldquo;You wanna run this school? I wanna run this school. Only one of us is gonna make it; and it&rsquo;s gonna be me.&rdquo; I turned my body in Gary&rsquo;s direction, who was looking at me with utter confusion. </p>
<p >&ldquo;What the fuck, Pete? Who are you talking to, exactly?&rdquo; I ignored him, offering my own explanation. </p>
<p >&ldquo;You always say that to Jimmy a day or two after Halloween&hellip;&rdquo; wincing as I adjusted myself so I was sitting cross-legged on the couch, I carefully met Gary&rsquo;s confused gaze. &ldquo;And I never got why you always betrayed him like that, you know? I mean, Jimmy&rsquo;s&hellip; <em>Jimmy</em>, he doesn&rsquo;t wanna take over the school&mdash;he just wants to fuck around.&rdquo; I sighed, before smiling tentatively. &ldquo;But&hellip; I think I get it now&mdash;you don&rsquo;t trust us &lsquo;cuz you think we&rsquo;re gonna&hellip; I dunno, stab you in the back or something.&rdquo; I shook my head. &ldquo;But&mdash;while I can&rsquo;t speak for Jimmy&mdash;I really do <em>want</em> to help you with your crazy plan; I couldn&rsquo;t care less about taking over the school, but it seems like it&rsquo;s important to you, and you&rsquo;re my friend, so&hellip;&rdquo; I shrugged, sniffing and wiping my nose off on my sleeve before giving Gary a grin. </p>
<p >&lt;&gt;The humming of the vending machine and beeping of the video game in the corner filled the room as Gary stared at me like I&rsquo;d proposed they bulldoze the school and build a dairy farm on the remains. As the silence stretched on, Gary&rsquo;s face slowly became more and more incredulous until I burst into giggles; the whole situation was already pretty dang ridiculous! &ldquo;Wh&mdash;<em>what</em> are you <em>talking</em> about?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I snorted a bit more before replying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <em>loooong</em> story Gary, trust me.&rdquo; Even as I braced myself for what was no doubt going to be an involved discussion, I felt the loneliness that had been curdling my insides for the last few hours&mdash;years, really&mdash;start to diminish. <em>Maybe&hellip; I </em>don&rsquo;t<em> have to be alone.</em> </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >The party had come and gone, and the common room was devoid of everybody except Ivan, who was passed out on the couch. Jimmy and Gary were sitting at the poker table, which had a &ldquo;pot&rdquo; of various snacks in the middle of the table. Judging from Jimmy&rsquo;s scowl and Gary&rsquo;s gloating grin, I figured Gary was winning. Crumbs, candy wrappers, and marbles were scattered across the floor. I wanted to help clean up, I really did, but it <em>was</em> my last day. So I figured I could get away with hanging out with them for a little while longer. </p>
<p >Gary&rsquo;s chair came back down from its two-legged lean against a wall with a thud as he laid out his cards for Jimmy to see. &ldquo;Read &lsquo;em and weep, Jimmy-boy! I take the pot!&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Maaaaan, FUCK this game!&rdquo; Jimmy threw his cards down in disgust. As Gary dragged the pile of candy to his side of the table all the while sporting a gloating grin, Jimmy glared at him. &ldquo;How do you do it? You&rsquo;ve gotta be cheating, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary wagged his finger at Jimmy. &ldquo;Ah, ah, ah, Jimmy-boy! A magician never reveals his secrets.&rdquo; Jimmy just groaned, while I rolled my eyes. </p>
<p >&ldquo;He counts the cards, and keeps track of the probabilities based on what&rsquo;s been laid out beforehand,&rdquo; I caught the piece of candy that Gary threw at me and elected to ignore the pissy look he was also throwing my way. &ldquo;Aw, I hate these bubble-gum lollipops..&rdquo; I held it out to Jimmy questioningly, who shrugged and took it. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Really, Pete; if you could not lay out the proverbial cards before we need to, please?&rdquo; Gary resumed leaning back in his chair, unwrapping one of the many candies from his pile. </p>
<p >I grinned suddenly, and punched the air in victory. &ldquo;Yess! Twenty-seven! New record!&rdquo; Jimmy and Gary looked up at me from the food they were eating in mild confusion. </p>
<p >When I didn&rsquo;t offer any explanation for my outburst, Jimmy looked at Gary. &ldquo;You know what the fuck he&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; Gary's eyes just flicked from Jimmy to me appraisingly. </p>
<p >I laughed, crossing my arms. &ldquo;Number of times Gary&rsquo;s called me &lsquo;Pete&rsquo; this time around. Twenty-six was the old record. That was&hellip; two loops ago.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary chuckled as he popped a redvine in his mouth. &ldquo;What, you keep track of that, Femme Boy?  </p>
<p >&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the most useful things to keep track of, actually,&rdquo; Jimmy&rsquo;d already tuned the conversation out, instead rooting around for more snacks. I elected to ignore this. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty good way to gauge how much you respect me, which ties into a lot of other stuff in terms of making stuff happen or not happen at the school,&rdquo; I gave a <em>what can you do</em> shrug. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty influential person, after all!&rdquo; Seeing Gary&rsquo;s blank expression, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should really be saying all this on the last day I&rsquo;d get to see these two. I&rsquo;d only told them the basics of the time loops, and given them enough information to make them believe my situation. I didn&rsquo;t really want to go into the specifics, since I knew I&rsquo;d eventually miss having somebody to confide in. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Just how many times have you done this, Petey?&rdquo; Gary scrutinized me, but instead of the usual anger that seemed to accompany Gary not understanding something, he seemed&hellip; worried? Concerned? &ldquo;You seem to know quite a lot about us. Just how much do you know?&rdquo; <em>I guess I do owe them an explanation of what I know.</em> Jimmy was paying attention again. </p>
<p >I shifted so I was sitting up straighter in my chair, rubbing the back of my neck while I talked. &ldquo;Um. Well&hellip; I&rsquo;ve lived through twenty-three of these loops, which is about fifteen years,&rdquo; Gary nodded, like he&rsquo;d been expecting an answer of that nature. Jimmy, however, goggled at me. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Wait, so you&rsquo;re actually, like, thirty years old or something?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I laughed sheepishly. &ldquo;I guess so, but it doesn&rsquo;t really feel like it?&rdquo; I shrugged as Jimmy gave me a &lsquo;I am totally lost&rsquo; look. &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;ve never lived on my own or had a job or anything, so it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m an adult,&rdquo; <em>I don&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;ll ever get to grow up</em>&hellip; I looked down at the floor, not liking the turn this conversation was taking. </p>
<p >Gary snorted incredulously. &ldquo;Puh-<em>lease</em>, Petey. I&rsquo;ve lived with you for a year, and you&rsquo;re the most sickeningly &lsquo;mature&rsquo; person I know,&rdquo; By the time I glanced back up, he was challenging Jimmy to another game. <em>Naturally</em>. </p>
<p >Jimmy, being Jimmy, accepted. But he kept looking between Gary and me, as if expecting them to do something. Gary hummed distractedly as he started to deal cards, leaving me to continue staring off into the distance, thinking about mortality. </p>
<p >Finally, Jimmy broke the silence. &ldquo;You wanna play, Pete?&rdquo; he dragged his chair around the table so he was closer to Gary, giving me a place to occupy. I smiled, happy for the distraction. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; <em>Honestly, I&rsquo;ve been staring at nothing so much lately I&rsquo;ve started to feel like Gary</em>. Gary loudly voiced his objections, but I ignored him and Jimmy just pulled out his slingshot and shot Gary despite his protests. We played for a while, with Gary constantly needling Jimmy and me, Jimmy telling Gary to fuck off in various ways, and I would point out whenever somebody was breaking the rules. It felt natural, and I savored the feeling of home these simple interactions inspired. </p>
<p >Eventually, we all got too tired to even keep track of who was winning, and decided it was time to go to bed. But as we trooped out of the common room, Jimmy snapped his fingers. &ldquo;Oh shit, that&rsquo;s right, I didn&rsquo;t give you guys my contact info!&rdquo; He ran into his room and emerged a few seconds later with a sheet of paper. Ripping it into threes, he handed Gary and me a slip of paper. &ldquo;Here, write down your phone number and address,&rdquo; I took the paper indulgently, despite knowing it wouldn&rsquo;t do me any good. </p>
<p >Gary smirked, commenting &ldquo;Not sure I want you to know where I live, Jim-jam,&rdquo; But took the paper anyway. Jimmy just rolled his eyes. When we were done, Jimmy punched Gary in the shoulder and promised to call should he need a good therapist recommendation. Gary assured Jimmy that he would also be happy to sell him some of his meds, which I didn&rsquo;t find nearly as funny as they did.  </p>
<p >Jimmy then gave me an awkward, one-armed hug before quickly saying good night and entering his room. <em>Huh. That&rsquo;s never happened before</em>. &ldquo;Oh <strong>God</strong>; Femme Boy I swear, you&rsquo;d better not jump me tonight just &lsquo;cuz your boyfriend actually <em>touched</em> you,&rdquo; my smile turned into a laugh as I made my way toward the stairs. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Sheesh, leave it to you to ruin a perfectly nice moment,&rdquo; Gary was quick to follow me up the stairs. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s not ruined if the moment wasn&rsquo;t nice, Petey. That was probably the most uncomfortable hug I&rsquo;ve ever witnessed. And I&rsquo;ve hugged my parents!&rdquo; I laughed a little, but Gary&rsquo;s callousness is always a little sobering. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;ll make you feel better; I promise not to jump you tonight. Happy?&rdquo; But Gary was, surprisingly, not taking the opportunity to make fun of me.&nbsp; &ldquo;&hellip;What?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary gave me a <em>look</em>, one of those like way back when I&rsquo;d first entered the loops and would accidently say things I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to know but that Gary always caught, somehow. <em>That can&rsquo;t be good</em>&hellip; &ldquo;You know, we never did finish talking about how much you know&hellip;&rdquo; <em>Fuuuuck</em>. I didn&rsquo;t look Gary in the eye as I entered our room and started getting ready for bed. <em>I don&rsquo;t wanna think about this now</em>. He flopped onto his bed, keeping his eyes fixed on me. The silence stretched for a few minutes before he finally let out an annoyed sigh. &ldquo;<em>Ughhh</em>, c&rsquo;mon Petey&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t got all night,&rdquo; He stole a glance at his watch before adding, &ldquo;Well, day, I suppose.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I sighed, sitting down on my bed. &ldquo;Gary&hellip; I really <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want to talk about it, okay? I&rsquo;m tired&mdash;we can talk about it tomorrow,&rdquo; <em>That&rsquo;s not a bad </em>loop<em>hole, ha.</em> </p>
<p >Gary, naturally, looked annoyed. &ldquo;Why not? What&rsquo;s your problem, hm?&rdquo; Ignoring him, I just started changing into my PJs. Gary sighed. &ldquo;What, do you want me to <em>make</em> you tell me?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I straightened up from pulling my clothes on, glaring at Gary. <em>Now that&rsquo;s just uncalled for</em>. &ldquo;No.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Gary sighed, but apparently he wasn&rsquo;t really in the mood for a spat. He just shrugged and started getting ready for bed himself. I ignored the feeling of disappointment that caused. <em>There&rsquo;s no point in telling him about it, anyway&mdash;he&rsquo;ll just forget by tomorrow.</em> I sighed as I pulled the covers over my head. <em>Well&hellip; at least I managed to get through one loop without everything going to shit.</em> That <em>was</em> an achievement; I smiled to myself as I drifted off. </p>
<p >Once again, I fell asleep on Saturday, June 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2007. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >Somewhere in the distance, somebody&rsquo;s telling me to get up. I try to block them out, but whoever it is, they&rsquo;re annoyingly persistent. Eventually I figure I should at least try and answer, if only to get them to shut up. I forced out a groggy &ldquo;Whad&rsquo;ya want?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Whoever it was, they sure were cheerful. &ldquo;Rise and shine, Femme Boy! Today&rsquo;s the day!&rdquo; I shivered, and noticed that my quilt had disappeared. <em>Wait, quilt?</em> </p>
<p >I opened my eyes a crack, just in time to see Gary drop my quilt on the floor. He was saying, &ldquo;Come <em>on,</em> we&rsquo;re finally leaving this dump of a school; you&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to catch up on your beauty sleep later.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I bolted upright, wide awake. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you say!?&rdquo; Gary flinched a bit, but quirked an eyebrow at my reaction. </p>
<p >&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re finally leaving this dump of a school&rsquo;? Or &lsquo;you can catch up on your beauty sleep later&rsquo;?&rdquo; He backed away from me as he talked, moving toward his wardrobe. I scrambled out of bed, rushing toward the window. &ldquo;Sheesh Petey, I haven&rsquo;t seen you this eager since you mentioned you&rsquo;d made out with Lola before,&rdquo; <em>Holy SHIT the trees still have green leaves!</em> I stood gazing out the window for a bit, my jaw hanging open a bit, before my face split into a grin as I listened to Gary's voice continue in the background. </p>
<p >It was the start of a new day. </p>
