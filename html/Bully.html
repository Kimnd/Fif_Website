                    : An excruciatingly long story about a teenager who
                    is inexplicably sent back to the start of the school
                    year after failing to become the ruler of his school.
                    The teenager, being an asshole, learns to use this to
                    exploit those around him for his own whims.
                    This goes poorly for all involved.

                    : A less excruciatingly long story about a teenager who
                    is inexplicably sent back to the start of the school
                    year after helping somebody become the ruler of their
                    school. The teenager, not being an asshole, tries to
                    change the series of events that lead up to the previous
                    failure. It takes a bit, but he gets there eventually.
