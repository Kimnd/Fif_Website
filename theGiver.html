            <p >I don&rsquo;t really remember the first dream. I kind of remember excitedly telling my parents about it, but precision of language got in the way and I don&rsquo;t think they really got what the dream meant. I dream a lot, so it must&rsquo;ve slipped under the radar. It took me about a year to actually manage to describe the dreams to my Family Unit properly and I started taking my pill! That was around the time I became a Nine. </p>
<p >Me and Jonah&mdash;I mean, Jonah and <em>I</em>&hellip; we were already real good friends, but the Stirrings made us <em>best</em> friends, no doubt about it. In my mind, anyway. He was always so&hellip; I dunno, different. I guess that&rsquo;s kind of obvious, him being the Receiver, but still. All the other Sixteens (Jonah always points out the day that we were born for some reason, so I know my age better than most) are pretty easy to get to know after a short amount of time, even me! But Jonah&rsquo;s deeper than that. </p>
<p >Like this one time when we were Sevens, we were all playing a game, and I was on Jonah&rsquo;s team, but he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything, just standing there, looking at something. I was upset at his lack of interest in the game&mdash;I remember &lsquo;cuz I talked about it during Feelings&mdash;but when I asked him what he was looking at, he said &ldquo;I apologize for not focusing on the game, Asher. I was just looking at the trees. They&rsquo;re different somehow today, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I frowned, looking at the trees. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look distant&hellip; what do you mean?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonah shook his head, giggling, &ldquo;Different, Ash. Not distant.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;I apologize for not&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;&mdash;you&rsquo;re fine! Anyway, I mean they look like&hellip;&rdquo; Jonah lapsed into one of his precision of language hazes, and being a Seven I groaned impatiently. But I waited, Jonah always came out of these eventually. I spent the time looking more closely at the trees. They really didn&rsquo;t seem different, but then again when had I ever even noticed them? It&rsquo;s not like they change their locations each day like people. I heard somebody call our names. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Hey, Ash, Jonah, are you still playing?&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;We apologize for causing you anything inconvincing, but me and Jonah are tired.&rdquo; </p>
<p >He laughed a little&mdash;guess I had botched that sentence too&mdash;but looked disappointed. &ldquo;I accept your apology. But it&rsquo;s not really fun without you&hellip;&rdquo; And we both knew that I wouldn&rsquo;t play if Jonah didn&rsquo;t. So we both looked at him. </p>
<p >He was still peering at the trees really hard, muttering under his breath once in a while. He looked so grown-up, I snickered before turning back and shrugging. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play next time! Promise.&rdquo; As the boy turned away, Jonah got the Ahha look that indicated the end of his episode. </p>
<p >&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like somebody changed the light on the trees so that the lighted parts are more brightly lit, and the parts that aren&rsquo;t lit are even more dark.&rdquo; Jonah beamed in his Jonah way, not like he was really proud that he&rsquo;d said something so fancy and smart, but in the way that he was just happy being able to describe what he wanted. I was a bit embarrassed to not understand what he was saying, of course&mdash;as a Seven, I was supposed to have mastered this basic stuff at Four&mdash;but I was more upset by how I didn&rsquo;t understand, and that put a wall between us as friends. I wanted to be able to share everything with Jonah, but this was holding it back! </p>
<p >Apparently this showed on my face, because we spent the rest of playtime leaning against the fence together while Jonah described what he was seeing and what he had seen before. Eventually I did understand it, when Jonah compared it to the difference in what you can see during the day and during the night, or when the light in your room is on or off before bed. During the day, there aren&rsquo;t very many shadows because there&rsquo;s light everywhere. Nighttime has lots of shadows and darkness. </p>
<p >That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s amazing about Jonah, he sees everything in a way that you can spend so much time trying to understand. Even before Jonah was the Receiver, it was like he saw everything with a little more detail than anyone else I knew, even my Parents and Instructors. They see objects or people that are related to them in some way, what was relevant to them or to me. Jonah just sees. </p>
<p >But anyway, the dreams started way earlier for me than they did for my Mother and Father, so I guess I was earlier than most people. I didn&rsquo;t really have any of the words to describe how the dreams felt, so I just told my Mother and Father about how the dreams felt warm and that Jonah had been there. It took them a few times to actually realize what the dreams meant, my wording was so convoluted. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >Sometimes, I actually go a day without taking the pills. Not often, mind you!&mdash;I only do it when there&rsquo;s an unannounced holiday or something, but still. On those days I usually remember the dream that made my family unit realize that I was having Stirrings&hellip; </p>
<p >Jonah and <em>I</em> had been riding our bikes and had somehow ended up in the woods. In the dream, Jonah was lying on his back staring up at the trees and I somehow knew he had been talking a lot. At one point he&rsquo;d looked up at me and asked if I was boring him. I had asked if I could see something, to which Jonah replied that I wanted to <em>try</em> something&mdash;&lsquo;you can already see fine, Asher&rsquo;. Normally I would&rsquo;ve replied, but since it was a dream the next moment I was kneeling over his lap. Even in the dream, I was embarrassed to ask Jonah to take his tunic off, but I did anyway, and he did. Dream-Jonah let me move my hands around on his chest until I woke up. </p>
<p >&lsquo;Course, I never told Jonah about the dream. But on days when I don&rsquo;t take the pills, (it&rsquo;s not a lot, I swear!) or late at night when it wears off a bit, I sometimes wonder if Jonah would let me do that. It seems like such a weird thing to want, anyhow. I mean, what purpose does it serve? Even when I&rsquo;m off the pills and I kinda shiver thinking about asking him, I still don&rsquo;t understand why I even want it. Funny how if I talked to Jonah about it he would probably get it, and even be able to tell me what the feeling&rsquo;s called! </p>
<p >I was so proud when my parents told me that the Stirrings were perfectly normal! Usually when they had a Serious Talk with me it was because I was doing something different, something that interfeered with my interaction with others. So I took the pill without protest. But I had been surprised when the warm sensation had drained away as my dosage was upended over the next couple weeks. I&rsquo;d been upset about it, though when I talked about my upsetness Mother and Father made me realize that, of course, those feelings had made me act differently around Jonas than the other males in my group. That had, of course, made perfect sense&mdash;which just left me <em>more</em> upset because <strong>of course</strong> I had done something wrong! Without even meaning to!  </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >I&rsquo;m pretty lucky we&rsquo;re still friends after all this time. A lot of the kids in our year don&rsquo;t talk to each other anymore. But after I became a Fourteen, I realized I didn&rsquo;t want Jonah to stop being my friend. That Ceremony of Aging wasn&rsquo;t even that interesting, but it made me remember what the leader of the Community had said about Jonah back when we became Twelves. She had said he would be separate from the rest of us, that he would be different&hellip; and I realized I didn&rsquo;t want that for my friend! I mean, maybe I couldn&rsquo;t be a Receiver with him, but I could still talk to him and be with him. So from then on, I started biking with him to his job as the Receiver. He was surprised at first, but I could tell it made him happy. </p>
<p >So we kept doing it. I would talk about whatever I was learning that day, and he&rsquo;d listen. After a while I had asked him if he wanted to talk about what he was learning, but he&rsquo;d just shook his head. &ldquo;I like listening to you, Asher.&rdquo; So I kept talking. </p>
<p >But over time, I realized that Jonah almost <em>never</em> talked about himself. He&rsquo;d talk with me about the goings-on in the Community, or about what his sister was up to, or the next event I was planning as Recreation Head. But he wouldn&rsquo;t talk about his job. The more I thought about it, I realized I didn&rsquo;t know what the Receiver-in-training&rsquo;s training was actually like. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like I know the training procedures for every job in the Community, but I could guess pretty reasonably that a caretaker of the Old would probably need to learn how to help the Old move around without hurting themselves or something. But I didn&rsquo;t have a clue what kind of things a Receiver would need to learn. </p>
<p >As I rode home after work one night, I remembered the fateful Ceremony of Twelve where Jonah had been announced as the new Receiver. What had the Leader of the Community said were the duties of a Receiver? She&rsquo;d said something about it needing&hellip; wiseness? I guess? I decided to talk to my Family Unit about it at Feelings tonight. </p>
<p >Phillipa, being a Five, was getting more talkative at Feelings. And since I&rsquo;m the older sibling, I have to wait for her to be done before I can talk. It&rsquo;s getting easier as time goes on, but especially tonight it&rsquo;s very difficult because I have so much I want to say. Eventually she finished up, and my parental units sighed in release. They turned to me, and said &ldquo;How about you, Asher? Do you have anything you want to share?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I grinned at them. &ldquo;Surprisingly, yes!&rdquo; Everybody at the table except my sister laughed. She didn&rsquo;t get the joke, but oh well. &ldquo;Today I felt sad about Jonas.&rdquo; My parents nodded. They knew I had been keeping on good terms with him. &ldquo;Specifically,&rdquo; I continued, taking a deep breath to prepare myself for explaining something complex, &ldquo;I was feeling sad that&hellip; Jonas doesn&rsquo;t talk as much as I do on our walks.&rdquo; Yeah, that sounded all right.  </p>
<p >My father looked surprised. &ldquo;Are you sure about that, Asher? I know you sometimes say things without realizing what they mean.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I nodded vigorously. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure. I was feeling sad because&hellip; because I don&rsquo;t know as much about Jonas as he does about me.&rdquo; Mother smiled proudly at my clear wording&mdash;she&rsquo;s a teacher for Sixes, so she&rsquo;s always been most upended by my precision of language problems. &ldquo;I know how I&rsquo;m feeling, I&rsquo;m just not sure what I should do to feel&hellip; less sad.&rdquo; I looked back up from my empty plate at my Family Unit. &ldquo;What should I do?&rdquo; </p>
<p >My sister was falling asleep by this point, so she wasn&rsquo;t really paying much attention. Mother and Father, on the other hand, looked at each other very thoughtfully. &ldquo;Well, Asher,&rdquo; Father started slowly, &ldquo;I suppose it would depend on whether or not you think this is a problem to be solved.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I blinked. &ldquo;What do you mean? Of course it&rsquo;s a problem&mdash;Jonas isn&rsquo;t telling me about his wife, so I don&rsquo;t know him as well&hellip; um&hellip;&rdquo; Mother was giving me the evil eye and looking meaningfully in the direction of work bag&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t usually use her take-home Discipline Wand anymore, since my little sister has a much better grasp of language than me, but I still hurried to apologize. &ldquo;I apologize to my Family Unit for using incorrect wording&mdash;Jonas not telling me about his <em>life</em> is&hellip;&rdquo; I took a deep breath, trying to put my words together carefully. &ldquo;a problem because I feel like&hellip; I can&rsquo;t be his friend if I don&rsquo;t know much about him.&rdquo; There, much better. </p>
<p >Mother and Father nodded thoughtfully.&nbsp; While they thought, Philpa began to yawn, having paid my&nbsp; sharing very little attention. After debating for a few moments, Mother got up, saying &ldquo;Come on, Philipa, let&rsquo;s get you to bed!&rdquo; </p>
<p >As she was being picked up, she waved her arms toward the shelf, saying &ldquo;What about Littlefoot?&rdquo; Mother smiled, grabbing the Comfort Object on her way upstairs. I grinned as I heard her happy cries going upstairs. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Now, Asher.&rdquo; I started, turning back to Father. He had his &lsquo;serious talk time&rsquo; face on. &ldquo;You know that it&rsquo;s rude to ask people about themselves. It draws attention to how they are different.&rdquo; He raised his eyebrows at me, and I nodded, surpressing a sight. I&rsquo;ve heard this lecture thousands of times before. &ldquo;Do you think Jonas wants to be reminded of how isolated his Assignment makes him?&rdquo; I blinked; I hadn&rsquo;t thought about <em>that</em>. </p>
<p >&ldquo;I, uh&hellip; I dunno.&rdquo; Looking at my empty place, I thought about it for a second before saying &ldquo;Porpusly not, I guess.&rdquo; Father frowned and gave the &lsquo;percision of language&rsquo; look. &ldquo;Oh, uh. Preferably? No, um&hellip; probably. Probably not.&rdquo; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >&nbsp; </p>
<p >~~~[long story short: they&rsquo;re all &ldquo;yeah let it go dude&rdquo; and ash is all &ldquo;I gueeeeess&hellip;.&rdquo;] </p>
<p >A few weeks went by and I followed Mother and Father&rsquo;s advice to not discuss Jonas&rsquo; life if he didn&rsquo;t bring it up. Which he didn&rsquo;t. But he did seem to notice that I felt kind of antsy about something, since he kept asking me if I was all right. &ldquo;You seem a bit distracted, Ash&mdash;are you okay?&rdquo; I told him I was fine, which was technically true&mdash;it was Jonas who wasn&rsquo;t fine, after all. </p>
<p >But I really didn&rsquo;t like not just telling Jonas how I was feeling. I mean, I wouldn&rsquo;t say something like this to somebody else in the Community, of course. But it&rsquo;s <em>Jonas</em>; even if he did get offended by what I said, we&rsquo;ve said things that we&rsquo;ve regretted to each other before. Plus, Jonas knows how I am with talking, so he&rsquo;d probably understand what I meant even if I didn&rsquo;t say it perfectly. </p>
<p >I kept thinking all this stuff before going to bed for a couple of nights, and I even started having dreams about talking to him. In one, my tongue fell out as I was trying to explain what I mean, which dream-Jonas found funny, and my parents thought it meant that my subconscious was telling me it was a bad idea. I really doubted my tongue would fall out when I started talking about it with him, but it was enough to keep me from bringing it up. Which is silly when I think about it, but oh well. </p>
<p >One day, though, there was an unannounced holiday! I was eating breakfast at the time, and yelled with my mouth full. I apologized before running straight for the bathroom to get ready&mdash;plus, I made sure to take my pill out and &lsquo;take&rsquo; it right before I brushed my teeth, so that I could spit it out. </p>
<p >I rushed out of the house and hopped on my bike, heading straight for Jonas&rsquo; house. With the Stirrings flaring up again at the prospect of a whole day with free reign, my confidence went up too, and I was able to seriously consider the idea of <em>really</em> talking to Jonas for the first time in a few days. </p>
<p >Jonas wasn&rsquo;t in his Family Unit&rsquo;s dwelling, but his little sister told me that he had headed off in the direction of trees where children usually played games. I loved that clearing, but Jonas isn&rsquo;t really into playing games&mdash;I thanked Lily and wondered why Jonas would wanna go there as I rode. </p>
<p >Finally arriving at the clearing, I hopped off my bike and waved to some of the younger children that I recognized from my training to be Recreation director. Luckily they all seemed pretty busy and weren&rsquo;t paying any attention to me so I was able to look for Jonas. He was sitting by a tree with a notebook in his lap, and he seemed to be concentrating really hard on it. He didn&rsquo;t notice when I walked up, so I couldn&rsquo;t help but glance at what he was writing. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Whoa! What is <em>that</em>?&rdquo; There wasn&rsquo;t writing on the page of the notebook Jonas had open&mdash;it looked more like a picture. But it wasn&rsquo;t of anything I had ever seen.  </p>
<p >Jonas jumped a little before catching his breath and glancing up at me. &ldquo;Sheesh, Ash don&rsquo;t scare me like that!&rdquo; </p>
<p >Automatically, I said &ldquo;I apologize for scaring you, Jo&mdash;&rdquo; But he was smiling and motioned for me to sit down, so I figured I didn&rsquo;t need to apologize if he wasn&rsquo;t even upset. I sat down cross-legged next to him, but couldn&rsquo;t help adding &ldquo;So what is that?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He frowned at the paper, absently replying &ldquo;It was a moment from a dream I had the other day, but I&rsquo;m having trouble remembering the specifics.&rdquo; Jonas was already bent back over the notebook, and was scribbling repeatedly over various areas doing something to them to make them look better, I guess. I couldn&rsquo;t really tell. </p>
<p >&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad&mdash;I hate that when you know you had a really good dream but you just can&rsquo;t regal it.&rdquo; He nodded a bit distractedly, I could tell he was concentrating. That was okay, just being with him was exciting today. I shifted so that my arm was touching his and I felt the Stirrings flare up right away; I smiled, and leaned back against the tree we were sitting next to, watching the children play their impromptu game of Tag. We sat that way for a while before I asked &ldquo;So what was the dream about?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Nothing in particular prompted me to ask, I was just kind of thinking about some of the Stirring dreams I&rsquo;d had about Jonah and the question just came out. My teachers call it &lsquo;poor pulse control&rsquo; or something. Jonah looked surprised that I&rsquo;d asked, which made sense&mdash;I don&rsquo;t even know if you&rsquo;re allowed to share a dream with somebody outside your family unit. </p>
<p >But then he got this sad look, and sighed. &ldquo;I&hellip; can&rsquo;t tell you, actually.&rdquo; He grinned at me sidelong, adding &ldquo;I apologize for having to follow the rules for the Receiver-in-training, Asher.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I felt my shoulders slump. This was the first time Jonas had told me anything about his job, but it was only to tell me he couldn&rsquo;t talk about it! &ldquo;Aw&hellip; I accept your apology, Jonas&hellip;&rdquo; I sighed. He nodded, smiling before turning back to his notebook. I watched him add more lines to his picture, when I had an idea. &ldquo;Hey, could you <em>show</em> me what your dream was about?&rdquo; That made Jonas look at me in surprise. </p>
<p >He looked confused. &ldquo;&hellip;What do you mean by &lsquo;show&rsquo;, Asher?&rdquo; Wow, that didn&rsquo;t normally happen&mdash;usually he&rsquo;s the one saying confusing things to me! </p>
<p >I pointed to his notebook, happy to have an idea. &ldquo;You could make a picture like that of what happened&mdash;that wouldn&rsquo;t be <em>telling</em> me what the dream was about, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be against your rules, right?&rdquo; Jonas&rsquo;s eyes widened as I explained, and he seemed to understand what I was saying. But he looked oddly&hellip; frightened? </p>
<p >Even so, he stopped and scrunched his mouth so it was leaning to the side&mdash;that was his &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; face. I grinned, glad he was giving it some serious thought. That meant my idea wasn&rsquo;t terrible, at least! Eventually, he said slowly &ldquo;I&hellip; I suppose that wouldn&rsquo;t violate the rule&hellip;&rdquo; I turned my body to face him, rather than sitting next to him, trying to keep myself from bouncing up and down from glee. It worked! &ldquo;&hellip;but&mdash;&rdquo; Drat! &ldquo;&mdash;It&hellip; well, <em>you</em> were in the dream too, Ash&hellip; I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; Here his face turned weirdly&hellip; darker than it normally was and he didn&rsquo;t meet my eyes. His next words came out faster than he normally talked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I should tell you about it&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >I started feeling a&hellip; clenchy feeling in my tummy when he said that. I mean, I wanted to hear about the dream&mdash;<em>especially</em> if it was about me!&mdash;but&hellip; if it wasn&rsquo;t something Jonah wanted to tell&mdash;er, show&mdash;me, I couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it. &ldquo;Oh. Um&hellip; Oh no, did I do something bad? In the dream, I mean?&rdquo; I hoped not, but the recent dreams of Jonah laughing at me would definitely fall under &lsquo;doing something bad&rsquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;d feel terrible if Jonas had to deal with something like that for me! </p>
<p >To my surprise, though, Jonas laughed a little and shook his head before meeting my eyes again. &ldquo;Oh, no, <em>definitely</em> not bad&hellip;&rdquo; His face got even darker. Could he tell his face was doing that? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; hm&hellip;&rdquo; and he put his thinking face back on, this time looking at the notebook. &ldquo;How to put it&hellip;&rdquo; Then he started drawing, sometimes glancing up at me intendedly. </p>
<p >I was regretting not taking the pill, just a little&mdash;the Stirrings were going crazy with the way that Jonah was looking super focusedly at me. I decided to watch what he was drawing instead. It looked a <em>bit</em> like a Community Dwelling. &ldquo;Oh, is that a Dwelling?&rdquo; He smiled, and nodded a bit. I watched him write in two people in front of the dwelling, and as he added features to them I suddenly realized &ldquo;That&rsquo;s you and me!&rdquo; </p>
<p >He nodded again. &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Then he looked at me like he expected me to say something. I switched between him and the paper&mdash;what was he trying to say? That the dream was about the two of us being at one or the other&rsquo;s Dwelling? He frowned when I just kept feeling confused. &ldquo;hm&hellip; Oh, I think this might help.&rdquo; He erased a bit of us and re-drew them to be a little taller&mdash;and he drew in a smaller figure standing in front of us. Filling in the details, I could see it was a young girl&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t tell how old she was, but she was clearly not a Ten yet. He also drew it so the two of us in the picture had our hands on her shoulder and were smiling at her. I looked up at Jonas, who asked &ldquo;Does that make a little more sense?&rdquo; I frowned, examining the picture. What could he be trying to say? He made us larger, does that mean&hellip; we were older in the dream? </p>
<p >&ldquo;Are we... adults?&rdquo; Jonas grinned, and nodded. &ldquo;Oh! Okay. So... whose Dwelling is that?&rdquo; he just raised his eyebrows, and tapped his pencil on drawing-us. I tilted my head to the side a bit to try and understand. &ldquo;&hellip;it&rsquo;s&hellip; ours? But who is the girl?&rdquo; He smiled now, and looked down when he tapped the smaller versions of ourselves again before looking back up at me. Now I really didn&rsquo;t get it. &ldquo;What do you mean? Is that&hellip; Phillipa? Oh, or Lilly?&rdquo; Jonas bit his lip, frowning&mdash;he&rsquo;s so good with words, it must&rsquo;ve been frustrating for him to have to try and get me to understand him without just telling me. &ldquo;I apologize for not being able to understand, you Jonas&hellip;&rdquo; But he shook his head. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it, Ash.&rdquo; he moved to close his notebook as he talked, looking at it more than me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty&hellip; radical idea, anyway.&rdquo; And he looked so sad when he said that, I couldn&rsquo;t just not say anything! </p>
<p >&ldquo;No! Its&hellip;&rdquo; I reached out my hand, keeping the notebook open. &ldquo;I can fluster it out, I <em>can</em>!&rdquo; Jonas smiled and shrugged, letting me re-open the book to look at the picture again. I stared at it, especially at the girl. She was the key, I could just tell. Jonas had said it was a radical idea&mdash;so that meant his dream had been about something I&rsquo;d never even thought of before, probably&hellip; No, <em>focus</em>! Okay. So, if Jonas and I are adults, and the Dwelling behind us is ours, then how would the girl fit into the picture? Wait&hellip; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Dwelling is it, exactly? Yours or mine?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas smiled and laughed a little, but it weirdly didn&rsquo;t seem all that happy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <em>ours</em>. We were&hellip; a Family Unit in the dream.&rdquo; He looked back down at the page. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t actually have children&mdash;I just thought that might help you get what I was trying to convey.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I tilted my head, looking from the picture to Jonah and back. A Family Unit? With Jonas? &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t Family Units need one mother and one father? How could a Family Unit have two fathers?&rdquo; Jonas sighed sadly, and shrugged. I remembered my dream about having my tongue falling out. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; I guess dreams don&rsquo;t always make sense. I returned my gaze to the picture, and noticed that the drawings of us were smiling. I smiled too, adding &ldquo;Well, we look happy&mdash;so it was a good dream, then?&rdquo; as I leaned back against the tree, and against Jonas a little. The Stirrings, along with how he brightened up and nodded when I said that made my stomach feel really&hellip; weird. Not in a bad way, but just&hellip; bubbly. I guess. </p>
<p >Either way, Jonas leaned back against the tree with me and we sat like that for a while. Eventually, I felt him lay his hand on top of mine, and I was surprised by how natural it felt. I closed my eyes, trying to feel the Stirrings, and Jonas&rsquo;s hand, and the weirdness in my chest all at once. It was pretty hard&mdash;it&rsquo;s a good thing I usually take the pill, dealing with so many feelings all the time would be really tiring. As we were sitting like that, though, I suddenly noticed a small bubble of&hellip; something in my mind. I focused on it, and it grew slowly but steadily&mdash;it felt so <em>warm</em>, so&hellip; bright&mdash;what was it? It started to form a really blurry image, of a room with twinkling lights everywhere and&hellip; some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling. I tried to focus on that feeling; I wanted to know what it was! Suddenly, though, Jonas snatched his hand back from mine and the bubble popped. &ldquo;Oh shi&mdash;I-I apologize for touching you without your permission, Asher!&rdquo; I opened my eyes, noticing that Jonas had moved away from me a bit. </p>
<p >Oh no, I didn&rsquo;t want that! &ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s okay, Jonas&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t want you to stop!&mdash;&rdquo; I covered my mouth when I realized what I&rsquo;d said. Members of the community are allowed to touch when necessary, but people just don&rsquo;t touch one another for no reason outside children and parents! To my surprise, though, Jonas actually started smiling after he realized what I&rsquo;d said. He looked around, but there wasn&rsquo;t anybody really around&mdash;the children that had been playing had long since moved on to other games, I guess. </p>
<p >He then scooted closer to me and slipped his hand under mine so that our fingers were intertwined together. &ldquo;better?&rdquo; He whispered into my ear. I shivered&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t even call <em>that</em> Stirrings&mdash;more like Vibrations. </p>
<p >I nodded. </p>
<p style="text-align: center; line-height: normal;">~~~~~~~~~~~~ </p>
<p >After I went home to my Family Unit for Feelings, I was trying to explain why I was so happy, but I couldn&rsquo;t think of any way to talk about it without mentioning how Jonas had explained his dream to me, or how we&rsquo;d touched, or the&hellip; warm, light-picture I&rsquo;d seen. I felt like these things were just between Jonas and I&mdash;so I just said that he&rsquo;d talked about his duties as Receiver-in-training on his own. Which was&hellip; kind of true&mdash;I did learn something more about his job; it must got something to do with dreams, or else there would be no reason to forbid him from dream-telling. Which was really weird, when I thought about it&hellip; how could he go through Dream Telling in the morning with his Family Unit without lying? Then again, I was able to tell my Family Unit about my Stirrings dreams and they never realized what they were about, maybe Jonas does something similar, only on purpose? </p>
<p >Ah well, either way&mdash;my Mother and Father were both happy to hear that Jonas had decided to talk to me on his own, and that I&rsquo;d followed their advice. Which made me feel a little bad for bending the truth, but I couldn&rsquo;t go back now. </p>
<p >The next time I saw Jonas I was surprised by the flare of something warm in my chest. I&rsquo;d taken my pill today, so I shouldn&rsquo;t have been feeling any Stirrings&mdash;but as we talked about our plans for the day (or I talked and Jonas listened), I realized it didn&rsquo;t feel like the Stirrings, it was something different. It was that feeling of the picture of the lights, I think. Either way, that day at school was basically normal except for the extra warmth. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >Over the next couple of weeks, I started wanting to touch Jonas even without the pills. It was weird&mdash;at first I didn&rsquo;t even realize I was doing something odd, but when Jonas and I were eating lunch one day and I kind of punched his arm (that sounds so bad when I say it like that!) at something funny he&rsquo;d said, the supervisor came over and reminded me to apologize. I felt <em>so</em> embarrassed. &ldquo;I apologize for hitting you Jonas; I didn&rsquo;t mean to flirt you!&rdquo; </p>
<p >I heard the supervisor sigh, but Jonas&rsquo;s face looked surprised before he started laughing. Over his laughing, the supervisor said &ldquo;You mean <em>hurt</em>, Asher.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I nodded, correcting myself automatically. &ldquo;Right, I didn&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;&rdquo; But Jonas actually interrupted me, still laughing a little. </p>
<p >&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to apologize, Ash.&rdquo; Here he stopped laughing and looked at the supervisor. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong, after all.&rdquo; The supervisor looked a little scared, actually, and just kind of&hellip; walked away after that. Then Jonas leaned close to me like he had when he held my hand and whispered &ldquo;besides, you meant to say &lsquo;flirt <em>with</em>&rsquo;!&rdquo; Then he snickered, and I joined in, even though I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what that meant. I didn&rsquo;t even know flirt was a word. After that, I figured it was okay if I touched him more than I did other people, so I did. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >A few weeks came and went, and I felt just&hellip; better than I normally did. Like normally when I wake up, I&rsquo;m excited because I get to go and do something I&rsquo;d been looking forward to or work on some cool new game at work. But now, I&rsquo;d also think <em>I get to see Jonas today</em> in addition to all that stuff. But what was weird was how even though Jonas didn&rsquo;t seem to mind me touching him more than most people, or asking him slightly more personal questions than Id&rsquo;ve asked another member of the Community, but he seemed like he wanted to hide it, I guess. I especially noticed when I tried to hold his hand in school and he&rsquo;d just put his hands in his pockets. He&rsquo;d looked around us before when it happened, too&mdash;the same way he had before he&rsquo;d held my hand the first time. I didn&rsquo;t really get why he was doing it, but I didn&rsquo;t want to ask&mdash;I was afraid of the answer, and anyway he was fine with it in private so I figured it wasn&rsquo;t a problem. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >Eventually, there was another unannounced holiday! I was so excited&mdash;I&rsquo;d get to spend the <em>whole</em> day with Jonas! I contemplated maybe <em>not</em> skipping my pill&mdash;the feelings I&rsquo;d had last time were so confusing, after all. But thinking about them, they hadn&rsquo;t felt bad at all, and it wasn&rsquo;t like the Stirrings were going to distract me from anything today; I didn&rsquo;t have any work to do. So I skipped it again, feeling a little buzz of fear and excitement from breaking the rules. Still, though&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t like it was a big deal. </p>
<p >I decided to not ride my bike, and instead I walked over to Jonas&rsquo; Dwelling&mdash;but on my way there, I saw Jonas riding down the street on his bike. &ldquo;Jonas! Hey!&rdquo; I waved, feeling the Stirrings and this new warmth flare up again when I saw him. </p>
<p >He looked nervous as he got off his bike, funny enough. &ldquo;Oh, hey Ash&mdash;where&rsquo;re you off to?&rdquo; I grinned as I ran up to him, and I hugged him. When I pulled away, he looked surprised before looking nervously around. </p>
<p >I didn&rsquo;t understand why he was so nervous about other people&mdash;it&rsquo;s not like anybody had said anything before now. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Jonas took a breath before giving me a smile and saying he was fine. &ldquo;Oh. Okay.&rdquo; Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have hugged him&hellip; </p>
<p >&ldquo;So, how about we go to the clearing again?&rdquo; I brightened up. That sounded like fun! I agreed, and we chatted as he wheeled his bike next to us, dropping it off at his Dwelling. Eventually, we got to the same clearing we&rsquo;d been in last time&mdash;there weren&rsquo;t any children around, though. Guess they were busy doing something else. Jonas suddenly took a deep breath, and turned to look at me with a very serious expression. &ldquo;Asher, we need to talk. About this?&rdquo; And he picked up my hand. I felt the warmth flare up even as I felt worried about what he was saying. </p>
<p >&ldquo;What do you mean? What&rsquo;s there to say?&rdquo; I squeezed his hand a little, letting the warmth fill me up. There was so much <em>more</em> than there was last time&mdash;and I&rsquo;d thought I was going to explode with all those feelings. </p>
<p >He sighed, shaking his head. It sounded more like he was talking to himself than to me. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let this happen&hellip;&rdquo; then he focused on me again. &ldquo;Ash, this goes against the rules of the Community, okay? If we keep this up, you could get in serious trouble.&rdquo; I frowned as Jonas dropped my hand and moved away a little. </p>
<p >&ldquo;What? Why? It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re doing anything wrong.&rdquo; He closed his eyes and brought the fingertips of his hands together like he was thinking. </p>
<p >He started slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s wrong either&mdash;not morally. But it <em>does</em> go against the rules, and that puts you in danger, okay Ash?&rdquo; He looked at me imploringly, like he really wanted me to try and get what he was saying. </p>
<p >I shook my head. &ldquo;Well what about you?&rdquo; He was talking like I was the only one doing something against the rules! </p>
<p >&ldquo;Heh.&rdquo; He half-smiled, one half of his mouth lifting up in a grin. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do anything to <em>me</em> that&rsquo;s any worse than what I already do.&rdquo; Then he met my eyes like he was asking me for&hellip; something. &ldquo;But I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> lose you.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I tilted my head, confused. &ldquo;But&hellip; but we&rsquo;re not doing anything <em>wrong</em>!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not like good feelings are against the rules. </p>
<p >Jonas sighed, and he suddenly looked <em>very</em> tired&mdash;like the knowledge in his head was weighing him up. &ldquo;I know, Ash. But it goes against everything the Community stands for, and they could&hellip; they could Release you for something like this.&rdquo; That made me stop and think for a second. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Whoa&hellip; really?&rdquo; He nodded a little sadly. I thought about it for a minute. What would living outside the Community be like? I know there are other Communities, I could probably find one to live in. Thinking about it, I had a great idea! &ldquo;Hey, we could be Released together! Then we could live together, just like in that dream you had!&rdquo; I smiled, thinking about it. </p>
<p >Jonah laughed, but it wasn&rsquo;t happy&mdash;it was almost&hellip; <em>mad</em>. &ldquo;Ha, no&mdash;they <em>can&rsquo;t</em> Release <strong>me</strong>. They wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle it.&rdquo; What? </p>
<p >&lsquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t be able to handle it&rsquo;? I frowned in confusion and automatically asked &ldquo;Handle what?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas sighed, looking down at the ground as he scratched his arm. His expression was&hellip; tired. Like he hadn&rsquo;t slept in a long time. Eventually he raised his eyes to meet mine as he began walking over to a tree. &ldquo;If you really want to know&hellip; I can explain. But it&rsquo;s a long story, Asher.&rdquo; He plopped down, raising an eyebrow as I moved to sit next to him. &ldquo;You sure you don&rsquo;t want to do something that&rsquo;s actually <em>fun</em>?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I laughed at that, scooting so our legs were touching. &ldquo;Things are always fun with you!&rdquo; </p>
<p >He smiled at that, and the Stirrings were going crazy by this point, since our legs were together in a way that kind of reminded me of my original Jonas dream. But his smile was sad, and he replied &ldquo;This story is definitely the opposite of fun, though. Depressing&rsquo;s probably a better word.&rdquo; He shrugged, saying quietly &ldquo;Not that any word could convey it properly.&rdquo; </p>
<p >He was quiet for a bit after that, and I just concentrated on how warm he was as the sounds of people going about their daily lives drifted over from the Community. I studied him, too&mdash;he had his arms folded across his knees, and he was looking away at something else. These kinds of lapses into quiet were different from the old &lsquo;persuasion of language&rsquo; things Jonas used to do, though. Usually he wouldn&rsquo;t even comment on them when he came out of it. Weirdly enough, I was looking at his arms and noticed that he had more hair than I did. Or maybe it was just darker? It was hard to tell. I ran my hand over the hairs without thinking, which seemed to draw him out of his trance&mdash;drat! I snatched my hand back and said &ldquo;I apologize for touching you without your permission, Jonas, I wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; thinking&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >I couldn&rsquo;t read his expression for some reason. But he eventually waved it off. &ldquo;Apology accepted. So, the first thing you need to know is that you can&rsquo;t ask any adults about this, okay?&rdquo; I blinked, but Jonas saw my confusion and continued &ldquo;Because what I&rsquo;m about to describe is something they were alive for.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Whoa! I nodded. &ldquo;Sure, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He nodded, and finally started his story. </p>
<p >&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the first Receiver of Memory-in-training for The Giver&mdash;er, the current Receiver of Memory.&rdquo; He paused, adding &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just call him the Giver; it&rsquo;s just easier.&rdquo; I nodded to show I understood, and Jonas nodded as he held my gaze and continued. &ldquo;Not long ago, there was another Receiver of Memory-in-training. And, well, the Giver lov&ndash;&rdquo; He cut himself off, changing his wording &ldquo;the Giver was&hellip; very fond of her. It made him happy to see her happy, so he began giving&mdash;&rdquo; He frowned in thought, cutting himself off again. </p>
<p >He tapped his chin as I wined. Man, it was so good! &ldquo;What? Gave what? It was just getting good!&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas laughed, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; hard to describe what he did. Basically&hellip; he cared more about making her happy than about training her as a Receiver.&rdquo; </p>
<p >My eyebrows shot up. &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t that part of his role in the Community? To ensure a new Receiver gets trained, since there&rsquo;s only one?&rdquo; How could somebody abandon the Community like that? </p>
<p >Jonas nodded. &ldquo;Yes. But he knew that if he really began training her properly&hellip; she would never be the same. And? He was right. To be a Receiver is to know pain; she never laughed or smiled after that.&rdquo; It was only after Jonas looked down at his feet that I realized I had almost lost myself in his eyes, leaning forward as I hung on his every word. </p>
<p >He was silent for a while after that. Gosh&hellip; Jonah must have lived through all that, too. I felt myself want to hug him and make him happy too, maybe like &lsquo;the Giver&rsquo; had wanted to do for the girl. But that was silly&mdash;touching his leg the way I was now was bad enough. Instead I just said quietly &ldquo;&hellip;and then what?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas blinked, looking back up at me, sighed, and continued &ldquo;A few months into her training, Rosemary decided she didn&rsquo;t want to live with the pain anymore.&rdquo; His eyes suddenly grew hard, and closed his eyes as he continued &ldquo;So she requested to be Released.&rdquo; </p>
<p >My jaw fell open at that! &ldquo;Y-you can <em>do</em> that!?&rdquo; He nodded, and I breathed &ldquo;wow&hellip; her poor Family Unit&hellip;&rdquo; They must&rsquo;ve been so ashamed. </p>
<p >A few more seconds passed before Jonas laughed coldly. I looked at him in astonishment, leaning forward, already lost in his eyes again. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t <strong>just</strong> her Family Unit that was affected. In the months that she&rsquo;d been with the Giver, she&rsquo;d Received a ton of memories. And when she was released&hellip;&rdquo; he mimed an explosion or&hellip; something, that drifted out over everything. He was very serious as he added &ldquo;Everybody in the Community Received the Released memories.&rdquo; </p>
<p >He stopped talking then, letting that sink in. I blinked, trying to understand what that meant&mdash;it was clearly a big deal, but&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t really know what kind of &lsquo;memories&rsquo; he was&nbsp; talking about. &ldquo;What memories?&rdquo; I frowned, scanning his face, and he looked like he&rsquo;d expected that. </p>
<p >He began reciting something, as if he&rsquo;d heard it so many times he could have said it backwards. &ldquo;The memories from before the Elders, before the Community&mdash;back and back and back.&rdquo; He smiled, continued &ldquo;They were mostly good memories, but there was quite a lot of pain mixed in there, too.&rdquo; I must&rsquo;ve looked confused because he said &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a way to think of it: what&rsquo;s the most painful physical experience you&rsquo;ve ever had?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I blinked, and chewed the inside of my lip in thought. &ldquo;Uh&hellip; I guess&hellip;&rdquo; I shuddered when I thought of the time Mother had used the wrong end of the discipline wand and I&rsquo;d had a welt on my face for hours. &ldquo;The time I got hit on the face by the wrong end of a discipline wand?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He nodded, and said &ldquo;Now, imagine if pain way worse than that suddenly just happened to you, completely at random, for reasons beyond your control.&rdquo; My eyes widened, and I swallowed. Jonas nodded. &ldquo;Yeah. That&rsquo;s why they were so desperate to get the next Receiver right. And that&rsquo;s why I can&rsquo;t be Released&mdash;because if they Released me, they would need to take on all <em>my</em> memories.&rdquo; He smiled, though it wasn&rsquo;t a nice smile&mdash;more like the kind of smile you give when you know you just beat somebody in a game. Tapping his head, he added &ldquo;And I have far more memories than Rosemary did.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">The next few seconds were just me with my jaw hanging open in amazement. Eventually, I said &ldquo;Wow&hellip; that&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; I felt my eyebrows come together in sympathy, and I said &ldquo;Y-you&hellip; you have painful memories?&rdquo; He sighed, nodding calmly. &ldquo;&hellip;oh. I&rsquo;m&hellip; I apologize for&hellip; you having to&hellip;&rdquo; But Jonas shook his head, interrupting me. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Ash.&rdquo; He smiled, looking in my eyes happily &ldquo;If it means you or Fiona don&rsquo;t need to experience it, that makes it worth it to me.&rdquo; He then reached out and laid a hand on my chest. Instantly, the Stirrings flared right back up, and I tensed up as he shifted so he was gripping my side a little before pulling away. Aw&hellip; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I laughed breathlessly, rubbing the back of my head as I said (maybe a little late) &ldquo;Gosh, really?&rdquo; The warm feeling flared back up as he nodded in confirmation. Looking in his eyes, my throat suddenly closed up and I felt my stomach clench&mdash;but not in a bad way. His eyes were so&hellip; deep, so&hellip; pretty. I never wanted to look away. My mouth suddenly opened&mdash;I needed to tell him, show him how intense this feeling, well&hellip; felt! &ldquo;I&hellip; Jonas, I&hellip;&rdquo; He tilted his head, indicating I should continue, but my mouth suddenly stopped working for once. Geez, talk about bad timing! Eventually I said all in a rush &ldquo;It, it means so much that you do that for me, thank you! I, um. I really like you, you&rsquo;re just such an amazing person.&rdquo; He laughed a bit, and his face got darker like it had before. I interrupted him before he could keep talking&mdash;I had so many feelings to tell him about! &ldquo;I guess I just, I want to spend time with you and&hellip; and&hellip; I want to help. You. Help you with that. Um.&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t planned on saying that, but now that I&rsquo;d said it, it was true! If I could help him with this&hellip; His eyes had widened in shock at that, but I didn&rsquo;t let him talk. &ldquo;Just, I want&hellip; I want to&hellip;&rdquo; I scrunched my face up in frustration&mdash;what could <em>I</em> ever do to help him? My grasp of the grass tightened as I leaned toward him, thinking back to what we had been talking about earlier. &ldquo;I feel&hellip; warm? Warm with you, Jonas; and&hellip; and I want you to be happy&hellip;&rdquo; I&rsquo;d dropped my voice to a whisper, and as I leaned forward I reached out and put one of my hands under his arm so it was behind his back&mdash;kind of like what he did earlier&mdash;so that I could pull him closer to me. As I shifted so my knees were on the ground and I could put my face closer to Jonas&rsquo;s, I felt my heart beating faster and my chest clenching up and my stomach (I think it was my stomach&hellip;) felt really hot for some reason. I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was doing, all I knew was I wanted to be as close to Jonah as I could be, especially his eyes; soon we were so close our mouths were touching, and his eyes were all I could see and my entire body felt really hot and kind of tingly for a few seconds. We sat like that for a little while and I felt a hot wave of jitters, or electricity, or something, run up and down my body until Jonas blinked. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">That made me freeze for a second, and I suddenly saw what we were doing and how wired it was, and oh no oh no, Jonas must hate me! I flung myself away as fast as I could, stammering &ldquo;O-oh my g-good!&mdash;Jonas, I&rsquo;m so, so sorry! I-I apologizes for&hellip; for&hellip;&rdquo; I trailed off as burning shame replaced that nice hot feeling, and the happy giddiness was replaced with this weird sense of loneliness at seeing him so far away. I mean, he was only a couple feet away from me; but after how close we had just been, it felt like I was suddenly in another Community. As he shook his head and blinked in surprise, my chest began to hurt at the lonliness of not being near Jonas anymore, and my eyes began stinging as I scrunched my face up trying to show how I was feeling. But it was too intense, and all the weird sensations and feelings made me suddenly let out a gasp&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t really a gasp, it was more like a&hellip; sad gasp? Either way, I started doing that a lot, and I couldn&rsquo;t stop. I was kind of scared now! Was I dying? That didn&rsquo;t make it any better; if anything it made the gasping happen more often. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">But I heard Jonas move and talk, even though I wasn&rsquo;t looking at him. &ldquo;Oh&hellip; oh, Asher, I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;shhh, shhh&hellip; it&rsquo;s okay&hellip;&rdquo; I felt him sit next to me and wrap his arms around me. It made me feel a lot better, and the gasps got quieter. He kept saying &ldquo;Shhh&hellip; shhh&hellip;&rdquo; over and over as he rubbed my back with one hand, but it really worked. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Finally I could talk enough to say (my voice sounded kind of sick) &ldquo;Ca-can you get&hellip; some pain relief? Please?&rdquo; He stopped talking at that, and I looked up to see he was frowning. It was one of those &lsquo;hard to read&rsquo; expressions he had&mdash;where I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t even understand half of what was going on in his mind to read it. Either way, now that I was better, I was able to scoot away&mdash;it was really mean of me to do that (the mouths-touchingly-close thing, not the lots-of-sad-gasps thing), and even though I liked it, I knew I shouldn&rsquo;t be that close to him. I realized my face was wet, and dragged the back of my hand over my nose and eyes. While doing so, I said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Geez, I&hellip; I dunno what that was about!&rdquo; I rubbed the back of my neck, laughing. Part of it was forced, but it <em>was</em> kinda funny! Jonas didn&rsquo;t seem to agree, though, since he didn&rsquo;t laugh. I trailed off as he stared off into the distance. I coughed, saying &ldquo;Um. Jonas?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He turned to look at me really slowly. It was like he was x-raying me, like when we get our physical examinations at school. It felt so strange, and I squirmed a little. &ldquo;Ash&hellip; you&hellip;&rdquo; But he seemed to lose his train of thought, so I took the opportunity to jump back into what I was saying earlier. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to do that, but I really do want to help!&rdquo; I nodded, determined. I pushed myself up so I was standing and held my hand out to him. I grinned as he blinked and snorted softly, smiling as he put his hand in mine. If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m good at, it&rsquo;s making Jonas smile! My grin widened as I pulled him up, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think of something, Jonas. I promise!&rdquo; I was so excited&mdash;from the Stirrings, the emotional rollercoaster I&rsquo;d just been on, and the lingering heat from the mouth thing&mdash;that I started running around the clearing kind of randomly, cheering. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Jonah laughed, making his way toward the road as I followed despite the random skips and jumps. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to do that, Ash&mdash;&rdquo; But I shook my head stubbornly. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;But I <em>want</em> to!&rdquo; I started thinking of ways to make Jonas happier. Maybe I could do something as Recreation Director? &ldquo;Maybe I could make a game out of one of the memories you really like!&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He grimaced, looking around. We were nearing the Community now, some Dwellings could be seen through the trees. &ldquo;Ash, just&hellip; maybe don&rsquo;t talk to anybody about it?&rdquo; He paused, then added quietly &ldquo;People might be sensitive about it, you know?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Oooh, that made sense. I grinned at him, giving a thumbs-up. &ldquo;No possum! My lips are sealed.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He laughed at that&mdash;a real laugh, and that made me feel&hellip; gosh, so <em>good</em>! I was so happy he wasn&rsquo;t mad at me! We spent the rest of the day just talking and hanging out. Again, I had to bend the truth at Feelings later that night, but I was too happy to care as I laid in my bed, closing my eyes and remembering the flood of heat when Jonas and I had been so close together. </p>
<p style="text-align: center; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">~~~ </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">This time the draining of sensation I felt when I took my pill the next day was really jarring. Oh well. I shrugged, and tried to spend some of the day thinking about Jonas&rsquo; pain. Not totally successfully, of course&mdash;I&rsquo;m easily distracted, but eventually, after I&rsquo;d dropped Jonas off at the Receiver&rsquo;s house (or&hellip; &lsquo;the Giver&rsquo;, I suppose) I started giving it some serious thought. What could really make Jonas feel better? From what he&rsquo;d said about&hellip; what had her name been? Rosie? Something with a flower, that much I knew; either way, Jonas had said she&rsquo;d only lasted a few months into being a Receiver-in-training, and he&rsquo;s been doing this for years already. I felt a weird surge of pride in Jonas&mdash;he&rsquo;s just&hellip; really good. Anyway, back to the matter at hand. I frowned as I peddled through the bustling streets of the Community toward my job training. It seemed like the hardest part of Jonas being Receiver is that he&rsquo;s the only one. Well, other than the Giver&mdash;but the two of them are alone. That&rsquo;s what the head Elder had said when Jonas had been assigned to be the Receiver, that he&rsquo;d be alone. But&hellip; did he really need to? After shouting an apology to somebody I&rsquo;d almost knocked over on my bike, I thought back to the story he&rsquo;d told me. If what he said was true, that the whole Community had somehow received the girl&rsquo;s memories after she left, surely that meant anybody could be a Receiver? Why couldn&rsquo;t I? I dropped my bike by the bike ports in front of the Recreation Office, chewing my lip as I thought about my own Assignment. I&hellip; suppose I couldn&rsquo;t just not be Recreation Director anymore. But&hellip; maybe I could do both? Or at least do the Receiving a little less than Jonas? Jonas didn&rsquo;t even seem to really <em>do</em> anything that had to do with his job; no paperwork, no meetings, no projets. Granted, he never really talked to me about it, so maybe he did and just didn&rsquo;t want me to know? But he talks about school projects just fine. I chewed my lip more as I made my way through the corridors of the office, finally reaching my mentor&rsquo;s office; I&rsquo;d have to give this some more thought. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">~~~ </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">It was a week later, and I still hadn&rsquo;t figured out what to do. I had actually asked my Family Unit about the story Jonas had told me about (I didn&rsquo;t mention it was him who&rsquo;d told me, though), and they&rsquo;d flat <em>refused</em> to talk about it. That was really weird&mdash;usually they at least give a reason why they don&rsquo;t want to tell me stuff, but&hellip; for this, they just said if I kept asking about it I would be punished. I&rsquo;d managed to stop asking after that. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I hadn&rsquo;t worked up the courage to ask Jonas about it yet, and when I&rsquo;d asked my mentor about taking on another Assignment, but not fully, she&rsquo;d just looked confused. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing, Asher&mdash;you&rsquo;re either Assigned to do something, or you&rsquo;re not. No in-between.&rdquo; Which was true, but a few hours later I realized that Jonas hadn&rsquo;t, strictly speaking, been Assigned to be the Receiver&mdash;he was chosen. Or something. I don&rsquo;t really remember the exact wording. But today, I was going to make real progress! See, I&rsquo;d realized something; the Receiver (the current one, not Jonas) was one of <em>the</em> most-respected members of the community&mdash;that meant that any decision he made was probably going to happen, no matter how everybody else felt about it&mdash;that was how it worked with the Elders, after all. Which meant if I could just talk to him, and convince him of my idea, maybe it might just work! I rushed out of school as soon as lunch started, happy I&rsquo;d told Jonas ahead of time that I had to work during lunch. I was panting by the time I made it to the Receiver&rsquo;s Dwelling, but I was just happy I&rsquo;d made it. I looked around for a clock as soon as I entered the building, relieved to see I had twenty minutes before lunch was over. Perfect! &ldquo;Can&hellip; I help you?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I blinked at the receptionist before shaking myself awake and back to action. &ldquo;Yeah! Um, yes, I&rsquo;d like to speak to the Receiver.&rdquo; There was a long pause after I said that, during which I took in the details of the office. It was kind of like a small version of the Recreation Office lobby, with only two chairs for waiting. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Eventually the woman said slowly &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, he&rsquo;s busy at the moment.&rdquo; She frowned at me, saying uncertainly &ldquo;Did somebody send you to speak to him?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I shook my head, bouncing on the balls of my feet in impatience. &ldquo;No, I just really need to talk to him. When can I talk with him?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">She looked really surprised for some reason. But she looked down at the desk, shuffling some papers that I couldn&rsquo;t see due to the height of the desk. &ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; It sounded like she ran a finger down some paper before saying &ldquo;It seems he is free for appointments from nine in the morning to eleven in the morning.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I groaned&mdash;that was when I had school! On an impulse (well, more than usual) I said &ldquo;Is he usually free at this time? That&rsquo;s when school is&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">She nodded, flicking her eyes meaningfully over to a fancy-looking door next to the desk. &ldquo;Sometimes. It&rsquo;s a bit hit-or-miss.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I perked up, adding &ldquo;So, if I just keep coming back at this time every day, I&rsquo;ll eventually be able to talk to him?&rdquo; I was grinning ear-to-ear; I couldn&rsquo;t help it! I hadn&rsquo;t expected to be able to talk to him at all, really! </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">It seemed like my smiling was infectious, since she smiled too. &ldquo;I suppose so, young man!&rdquo; She chuckled, adding &ldquo;Only one way to find out.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I nodded; good point. &ldquo;Thanks, miss! I&rsquo;ll be back tomorrow!&rdquo; I waved, before glancing back at the clock. I had five minutes to get back to school. After gawping at the clock for five seconds like an idiot I pelted out the door and on my bike. I was out of breath when I finally made it back, but I was on-time, at least. And I was one step closer to helping Jonas! That made smile and relish the coil of warmth that enveloped me when I thought about him. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I went back the next four days, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the fifth day that I was able to meet him. Over that time I got to know the office pretty well, if not the receptionist. It wasn&rsquo;t the same person each day. Anyway, the lobby looked boring but tasteful like most public buildings in the Community, but I started noticing small things&mdash;how the chairs were a little nicer than the standard straight-backed chairs most other buildings used, how the carpet was a little more plush than any I&rsquo;d ever seen, how there were&hellip; pictures on the walls? I think? Some of them looked like what Jonas had been doing that day, and I&rsquo;ve seen him doing similar stuff since. Others were actual photos like you see in textbooks of animals, but of a place. And one was&hellip; actually coming <em>out</em> of the <em>wall</em>. It looked like the book of the Rules of the Community, like every Dwelling and building has, but somebody had ripped all the pages out, pasted them together into a single paper, and nailed the book to it, with nails poking out through the spine. There was also this dark goop coming out of the nail-holes, and it looked so gross&hellip; but it flowed off the book, onto the wall itself, and had a little pool at the foot of the wall where it was hung up. When I first looked at it, I couldn&rsquo;t look away for what felt like an eternity. It made me feel <em>wrong</em>; like it was taking something I understood and looking at it from a completely different perspective. It was such a weird feeling that I swore it had to be breaking the rules, somehow. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">But it was in the building of the most important Elder, so it must&rsquo;ve been fine. Still, I made sure to look at it every time I came into the lobby after that. Finally, on the fifth day, the receptionist of the day said &ldquo;Actually&hellip; yes, he is avalible, now. Let me check in with him.&rdquo; She talked to him through a speaker, and I could just make out what sounded like an old man&rsquo;s voice. After a moment, she turned to me and asked &ldquo;He wants to know who you are.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Like the genius I am, I said &ldquo;Uhhhhh&rdquo; for a bit before finally saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m, uh, Recreation Director Asher.&rdquo; I bit my lip as she nodded, relaying the message to the speaker. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Moments later, she thanked him, and snapped the device off. Getting up she said &ldquo;Right this way, Asher.&rdquo; Then she smiled at me as she moved to the fancy door I&rsquo;d noticed my first day, adding &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t want to make you late for school, would we?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I grinned, shaking my head. &ldquo;Nope~!&rdquo; I added a wet <strong>POP</strong> to the word to give it a bit of emphasis as I entered the room. I was a little distracted by what was in it, so I didn&rsquo;t even notice when the door closed behind me. I&rsquo;d only ever seen this many books in the Office of Open Records! But it wasn&rsquo;t the same towering, crushing piles of data of the Office of Open Records, with their books all in the same binding&mdash;these books were of all types and sizes and shapes. And they felt a lot less intimidating, more inviting. Like they existed to be read, instead of existing to keep data around. Eventually I managed to take in details about the rest of the room&mdash;the luxurious touches I&rsquo;d noticed in the lobby were in full effect here. The furniture was dark, and ornate and curved and plush in a way that none of the furniture in my Dwelling is. Finally, my eyes found the person in the room; he was sitting in an easy chair, and he had a&hellip; something in his lap that he was tapping at. It was making a bizarre series of noises, but it sounded&hellip; nice. I straightened up, saying &ldquo;Ah, uh, hello sir! Mister Receiver, sir!&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">The old man looked up from his noisemaker, and he was <em>old</em> looking. I mean, really old. His face looked impossibly wrinkled. But what really sold it were the eyes&mdash;same as Jonas&rsquo;s. Though as I studied this man&rsquo;s face, I realized their eyes weren&rsquo;t quite the same&mdash;Jonas&rsquo; were a little harder, a little sadder. He smiled at me, set his instrument aside as he said &ldquo;Well, hello there. I hear you&rsquo;ve been trying to speak to me for some time.&rdquo; He sunk back into his chair and studied me as I stood by the door like an idiot. Same x-raying feeling as Jonas had given me.... </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">In response to his statement, I nodded. &ldquo;Yes, sir. It&rsquo;s been&hellip;&rdquo; I paused, subtly hiding one hand behind my back as I counted it out. &ldquo;&hellip;four days. I&rsquo;ve been coming over to talk to you each day.&rdquo; There was a couch, a desk with papers on it, and a bunch of strange objects I didn&rsquo;t even begin to understand. There was also a potted plant in the corner. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re an awfully persistent fellow, I&rsquo;ll give you that.&rdquo; I was surprised he said that, but he was smiling, so I figured it was a compliment. I tried to hide my smile, just nodding. &ldquo;So what brings you to my humble abode, Asher?&rdquo; He suddenly sat up, gesturing to the couch I&rsquo;d noticed. &ldquo;Please, sit! Sit. Can I offer you anything to eat or drink? You&rsquo;re skipping lunch, after all.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I sat down, not sure what he meant. Usually you only eat at specific times of day, depending on where you are. &ldquo;No thanks, sir.&rdquo; I should probably get to it, I needed to be back soon. &ldquo;I actually wanted to ask you if&hellip;&rdquo; Gosh, as I ran the idea through my head, it sounded so <em>dumb</em>. Still, I&rsquo;d come this far, I might as well go the whole way. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s possible for me to be a Receiver of Memory, too?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">~~~ </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I nodded as Fiona and Asher talked beside me. We were walking her to the House of the Old, and Asher was giving his usual detailed description of his day. Fiona met my gaze, smiling a little ruefully at our friend&rsquo;s antics, and I grinned back, feeling the now-familiar shiver of longing flare up as she looked back at Ash and her hair caught the light. I felt myself blush, so I focused on Ash instead&hellip; not that that was much better. I repressed a sigh as my dream from last night came back into my mind; hot breath in my ear as I ran my hands over a stiffening&mdash;I shook my head vigorously, trying to disguise my embarrassment with a cough. &ldquo;Alright Fiona, see you later!&rdquo; Waving good-by to Fiona, Ash and I continued on our way to the Giver&rsquo;s. Suddenly, Ash was practically bouncing up and down in excitement. &ldquo;So! Guess what <em>I</em> did today!&rdquo; He was looking at me with poorly-suppressed glee, and I smiled despite myself. He&rsquo;s so innocent, it&rsquo;s adorable. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I rolled my eyes, saying &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that what you were doing since we got out of school?&rdquo; He looked a little hurt, but I gave a playful smirk and he realized I was just kidding around. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Then, he shrugged, and&mdash;I nearly laughed&mdash;tried to look <em>coy</em>. &ldquo;Well, yeah. But I didn&rsquo;t mention the most imported thing!&rdquo; He gazed at me expectantly before adding excitedly &ldquo;So do you wanna know what I did?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I laughed for real that time, deciding to play along. &ldquo;Sure, what did you do?&rdquo; Maybe it was something to do with the new game he was working on? I think he had based it on the story I&rsquo;d told him about Rosemary. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He grinned wide, and, practically vibrating now, he gave a little jump as he finally said &ldquo;I went and talked to the Receiver! About me being one too, and he thought it was good idea!&rdquo; It took me a few moments to register what he had said, though I&rsquo;d already stopped moving forward. Asher, who&rsquo;d kept walking his bike along the path, turned to look back at me with the typical innocent confusion. &ldquo;Jonas?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">For a moment he looked just like one of the Memories, one where a boy takes his beloved dog and has to shoot it. Asher&rsquo;s expression was the same as the dog&rsquo;s&mdash;innocent confusion, unsure of what the person they&rsquo;re looking at is feeling. Eventually I managed to choke out &ldquo;Y-you what?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Asher blinked, clearly surprised by my reaction. &ldquo;I talked to the, um, Giver about being a Receiver-in-training with you?&rdquo; He paused, looking increasingly distressed. &ldquo;He, uh, seemed to be okay with it&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">That shocked me. The <em>Giver</em> had said yes!? I felt my chest clench up at the betrayal, and then anger swept through me. I growled &ldquo;Oh, is that so.&rdquo; How could he do that? He knows Asher is my friend, why would he give him false hope like that? I&rsquo;d resumed walking now, and I quickly caught up and passed Asher as I glared at nothing in particular. There&rsquo;d be some words today, that was for sure. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;J-Jonas?&rdquo; The sound of Ash&rsquo;s bike quickly caught up to me, and I saw him looking at me, worried, out of the corner of my eye. &ldquo;I, uh, apologize for making you angry, Jonas&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off and I sighed. No point getting angry at Ash. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I said, of course, &ldquo;I accept your apology, Ash.&rdquo; I sighed, looked up at him and added &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not angry at you.&rdquo;  </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He smiled in relief before going &ldquo;Oh. Wait, then&hellip; who are you angry at?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I huffed as we rounded the corner to the Giver&rsquo;s Dwelling. Or office. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m angry at the G&mdash;er, the Receiver.&rdquo; And to myself, I added &ldquo;He should&rsquo;ve waited to talk to me first.&rdquo; Then, I looked up, and over to Asher. &ldquo;Hang on, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about this?&rdquo; I blinked, then narrowed my eyes, thinking over the last few days. &ldquo;Is <em>this</em> what you&rsquo;ve been doing at lunch?&rdquo;&nbsp;  </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">~~~ </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">(Annex room) </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">~~~ </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I could feel Ash&rsquo;s breath blowing over my back as he breathed hard; that wasn&rsquo;t the only thing that was hard, either. He was so warm in my hand as I stroked him, his breathing hitching whenever I changed my grip or rubbed the head. Throwing his head back, he moaned my name in a way that made me shudder, and I begin licking his neck&mdash;I vaguely thought that I should be&hellip; concerned? Surprised? About this situation, but the familiar flood of arousal banished such considerations from my mind. I began trying to leave marks on his skin, like I had experienced in some Memories; I wanted there to be some evidence of this happening. In between nips, Asher was practically squirming beneath my hand, needily moaning my name in a way that spiked the heat in my lower abdomen from mildly hot to scalding; I wanted to show him the joys of sex I&rsquo;d learned, wanted to show him just how much I love him. So I drew back from his neck and lowered my head to his erection. I couldn&rsquo;t see his expression well&mdash;that was odd, since there was plenty of light on the rest of his body&mdash;but I heard his gasp well enough. His hips bucked into my mouth as I worked, and he kept moaning my name and letting out other sounds of pleasure. Soon though, I realized he hadn&rsquo;t said anything substantial; he hadn&rsquo;t said what I wanted to hear. I pulled back so I was next to him, still able to run my tongue along his length, but also so I could speak. &ldquo;Ash, can you say something for me?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">There was a pause as I heard him catch his breath, expression still weirdly not visible from my angle. Then, with the confusion I&rsquo;d heard countless times from my friend, he asked &ldquo;Say what, Jonas?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I bit my lip&mdash;if I <em>told</em> him what I wanted him to say, it wouldn&rsquo;t mean anything; he had to say it himself. &ldquo;I think you know what I mean.&rdquo; I gently nosed his erection, still trying to read his shadowed face. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He tilted his head in thought for a while before shaking his head vigorously. &ldquo;Nope, definitely not, Jonas.&rdquo; I felt my stomach clench up fearfully for some reason as he brought a hand up to scratch at his ear, like he does when thinking. Eventually he said in his typical cheerful tone &ldquo;Maybe you could give me a hint? Like&hellip; what letter it starts with?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself from saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a phrase. Three words.&rdquo; Surely that would be enough? But apparently not; he shook his head again. The coil of fear had tightened now, and I added quietly &ldquo;The first is &lsquo;I&rsquo;, and the last is &lsquo;you&rsquo;&hellip;?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He was quiet, and I could imagine the look of dumbstruck confusion on his face. Eventually he said, somewhat jokingly, &ldquo;Nope! Still don&rsquo;t get it. What&rsquo;s the middle one?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Somehow, I managed to swallow the lump in my throat enough to reply &ldquo;It s-starts with &lsquo;L&rsquo;. Four letters.&rdquo; I flicked my gaze away from his face as I talked, instead addressing his still-erect cock. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He tapped his chin in thought before saying &ldquo;Uh&hellip; &lsquo;load&rsquo;? &lsquo;Long&rsquo;?&rdquo; My heart sank on every word he said, especially when he snapped his fingers and said &ldquo;Oh, &lsquo;like&rsquo;? &lsquo;I like you&rsquo;? That&rsquo;s sure true, Jonas!&rdquo; he said that with his typical carefree childness, which contrasted oddly with the sight of his saliva-slicked member. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I pulled back, drawing myself up to his height and pressing my forehead against his. Somehow, I still couldn&rsquo;t see his eyes even when they were right in front of me. Quietly, I said &ldquo;&lsquo;Love&rsquo;.&rdquo; I swallowed, added &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; for clarification. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">A moment&rsquo;s pause, and then Asher laughed. He pulled away, and now I could suddenly see his expression, pulled up in typical carefree amusement&mdash;but he was oddly&hellip; lifeless, though I couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint just how. As he laughed, eyes scrunched up, he said &ldquo;Geze, Jonas, you&rsquo;re usually the one with precision of language!&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">My blood ran cold, but I asked &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; even though I already knew the answer. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Asher finally stopped laughing to give me a bemused look, and only now did I notice his eyes weren&rsquo;t their usual hazel&mdash;they were the eyes I had seen in Asher&rsquo;s face countless times&hellip; before I&rsquo;d become a Twelve. Before I began Seeing Beyond. He continued, saying &ldquo;The word &lsquo;love&rsquo; is so generalized that it&rsquo;s meaningless, of course!&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I blinked, feeling the hot sting of tears build up behind my eyes as I said &ldquo;N-no it&rsquo;s not, Ash&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">But he didn&rsquo;t listen, frowning at me in a disappointed way. &ldquo;Of course it is; there is no love in the Community, Jonas.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;You of all people should know that.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I was going to reply, but I suddenly heard Lilly calling my name, and I felt a flood of fear, dread, and embarrassment as my gaze traveled over Asher&rsquo;s naked form. There was a knocking sound now, and my head whipped around, wondering what I was going to tell her&mdash;at which point I realized I was on a bed. I blinked sleepily as the rapping on my door continued and Lilly said, quite irritably, &ldquo;Come <em>on</em> Jonas, wake up! I&rsquo;d like to use the bathroom <em>some</em>time this morning!&rdquo; I pushed myself up from the bed, rubbing my eyes and sighing in relief. Just a dream. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;Sorry, Lil, be there in a &lsquo;sec!&rdquo; I took a shaky breath before getting out of bed and moving over to grab my sketchbook. I&rsquo;d been using it to record my dreams as well, lately. I didn&rsquo;t have dream-telling anymore (and I wouldn&rsquo;t be &lsquo;showing&rsquo; this one to Asher, that was for sure), but keeping a record of them makes me feel better, somehow. Like I&rsquo;m a little less alone. I slipped past my irritable sister into the bathroom to get ready for the day, sitting on the toilet to scribble some quick thoughts after a hasty apology. Plus, the Giver had suggested after I&rsquo;d began the sketches that I could submit my art to the Hall of Closed Records. The Elders would never want something as subversive as art available to the general populous, of course, but&hellip; he&rsquo;d pointed out that maybe my art could be seen by Receivers after I was gone. I smiled at the thought&mdash;the Giver himself had even taken up his own advice and was trying to write his own, original music. Of course, it was rather difficult trying to record it; the both of us knew that music had been written down, back and back and back, but the details of exactly how it worked were a minutia the Memories had rather left out. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I shook my head as I began running the water in preparation for a shower, trying to prepare myself for the day ahead. Breakfast was a quiet affair, with Mother detailing her dream, involving her somehow being buried under papers. She shuddered thinking about it. &ldquo;It felt so real&hellip;&rdquo; Father reached over and grasped her hand sympathetically, lightly squeezing it with a smile when she looked up. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Was supporting her head with her hand, a look of puzzlement on her face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it. You&rsquo;ve been having a lot of bad dreams lately. What&rsquo;s up with that?&rdquo; Heh, still as blunt as ever, Lilly was; that much hadn&rsquo;t changed with becoming an Eleven. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Mother and Father shared my bemusment, and Mother replied patiently &ldquo;Well, I have been settling some rather tough cases lately.&rdquo; Her brows furrowed as she recalled some of the recent cases she&rsquo;d mentioned, scant on details of course, about possible Releases. Only one had resulted in carrying out the sentence&mdash;a female birth mother who had twice now had miscarriages. I&rsquo;d had to bite my tongue pretty hard to keep silent about that one. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">The rest of the day passed generally as usual, though I again couldn&rsquo;t find Asher at lunch. According to a female friend of Fiona&rsquo;s named Clara he was working on something for his Assignment, but I was seriously beginning to doubt that after four days&mdash;I&rsquo;ve known Ash all my life and he&rsquo;s <em>never</em> been this much of a workaholic. When I saw him in afternoon classes, though, he seemed even more cheerful than usual, though out of breath. I resolved to ask him about it after school, though I found out pretty fast. I bade Ash farewell sharpish after figuring out what he&rsquo;d done. He was a little upset about my reaction, still apologizing even as he hopped on his bike to get to work on-time, but I knew he&rsquo;d be back to his usual cheerful self the next time I saw him. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Before I entered the annex room, I forced myself to take a couple of deep, shaky breaths. It didn&rsquo;t help as much as I&rsquo;d have liked, but it would have to do. As soon as I was in, I crossed my arms, looking meaningfully at the speaker. Looking up from the book and papers on his desk, the Giver nodded as soon as he saw my expression. There was silence as he walked across the room to the speaker, snapping it off. As soon as he did so, he let out a huff of air. &ldquo;I take it Asher told you what happened?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I kept my tone as clipped and even as I could. &ldquo;He said that you said he could be a Receiever. Is that true?&rdquo; I was really hopping that Ash had just exaggerated or misunderstood the Giver&rsquo;s words. He must&rsquo;ve misinterpreted the gentle disuasian the Giver had treated his &lsquo;idea&rsquo; with as acceptance somehow. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">We made our way to our respective seats now that the promise of privacy had been assured. The Giver sighed as he lowered himself into his chair. &ldquo;Not quite. I believe what I said to him was that I would give the idea some thought.&rdquo; I let out a breath I didn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;d been holding in&mdash;so the Giver <em>had</em> tried to politely dissuade him. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Still, though. &ldquo;Giving him false hope about such a stupid idea, though?&rdquo; I looked at the Giver beeseachingly for an explanation for being needlessly cruel to my best friend. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">The Giver raised one eyebrow. &ldquo;Stupid? Actually, I thought it had some&hellip; merit....&rdquo; He trailed off at my expression. &ldquo;&hellip;Jonas? Can you explain what&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">My lip had begun to curl up onto a snarl, and at that question my jaw worked soundlessly for a couple of moments. Then, I finally managed to say &ldquo;You think <em>Asher</em> could be Receiver!?&rdquo; He motioned as if to talk, but I was far from done. &ldquo;Ash is one of my <em>best friends</em>! He&hellip;&rdquo; my voice lodged in my throat at sheer number of reasons he couldn&rsquo;t do this. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&hellip; he&rsquo;s so innocent, he <em>can&rsquo;t</em> handle all the pain! The suffering?&rdquo; I shook my head, still hardly believeing that I even needed to point this out. &ldquo;I&hellip; I could never let that happen to him, he doesn&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo; I lifted my gaze back up to the Giver&rsquo;s, adding quietly &ldquo;Please, Giver&hellip; I love him, I can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; again, my voice cracked, but he nodded in understanding. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;I understand, Jonas.&rdquo; He passed me a glass of water and waited for me to finish drinking before adding &ldquo;Better than <strong>anybody</strong> I understand the damage the Memories can do to a loved one.&rdquo; I saw his eyes fall into shadow, no doubt hearing Rosemary&rsquo;s voice once again. I swallowed guiltily; of course the Giver understood. &ldquo;However, there is a difference here.&rdquo; A level stare. &ldquo;Different to you, to me, and to Rosemary&hellip; Asher, should he become a Receiver, would have done so out of choice.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I blinked, though I frowned after a moment. &ldquo;But he has no idea what it really means.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Another nod as he leaned back into his chair. &ldquo;True. But none of us did, at the beginning. And, judging by the explanation you gave him about Rosemary&rsquo;s Release, he understands better than anybody else in the Community what it means to be a Receiver.&rdquo; I felt my heart clenching up in fear and dread for my friend as some of the worst Memories swam before me&mdash;of War, Suicide, Rape&hellip; so much horror.... The Giver suddenly brought his hands down on his knees, bringing me out of my musings. &ldquo;Well now! I think it would be best if we got on to today&rsquo;s Memories and discussed this later.&rdquo; I nodded automatically, moving to take my tunic off as he added &ldquo;Jonas&hellip; I suggest you talk this over with Asher. I can make sure your conversation does not end up in the Hall of Open Records.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I swallowed; this was a dangerous game we were playing. I knew I would be fine, but if Ash kept up all this stuff, he could get into serious trouble. Still, though. &ldquo;Alright, I will.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="text-align: center; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">~~~ </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I knew I wasn&rsquo;t doing a good job helping my mentor today, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;I was too distanced to think about stuff like filing papers. Jonas&rsquo; expression when I&rsquo;d told him what the Giver had said&hellip; I&rsquo;d never seen him so mad before! It scared me, and not just because I was worried about him hitting me or something; if he didn&rsquo;t <em>want</em> me to be a Receiver, that would change everting. I&rsquo;d never even thought that he wouldn&rsquo;t want me to do it. I sighed to myself&mdash;of course it hadn&rsquo;t, I never think things through properly! I&rsquo;d only thought about it for a day before trying to go and talk to the Giver, and over the next few days Jonas&rsquo;s opinion didn&rsquo;t come up for me. I&rsquo;d wanted to keep it a &lsquo;surprise&rsquo;; stupid, stupid, <em>stupid</em>! I shook my head, forcing myself to focus on what I was doing&mdash;if I foucused on feeling bad, I would only do bad work. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">A few hours&rsquo; worth of boring but distracting filework later, I finally got back to my Dwelling. I was so lost in my own thoughts that I&rsquo;d somehow forgot about Feelings! Forcing myself not to panic while Philia began talking about her day, I started thinking about what to say. But Philia began describing how she&rsquo;d been disciplined today for pushing another girl, and I got distracted trying to help. Then, suddenly, Mother turned to me and said &ldquo;And you, Asher?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I blinked. &ldquo;Uhhhhh oh!&rdquo; Darn. &ldquo;Um. Yeah, um&hellip;&rdquo; I scratched the back of my head, trying to think of something to say; the truth was the first thing to come to mind. &ldquo;Jonas got kind of upset at me today.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t say anything else&mdash;I actually didn&rsquo;t know if I was allowed to talk to the Giver the way I had been, strictly speaking, and I didn&rsquo;t want to my Family Unit to get in trouble for it. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Silence as my parents (and sister) waited for me to go on. When I didn&rsquo;t, Father frowned. &ldquo;Remember Ash, you&rsquo;re supposed to be describing your reactions to these events, not simply giving a list of events.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I nodded. &ldquo;Well, I felt&hellip; guilty? For making him mad. I didn&rsquo;t mean to, I had just wanted to surprise him is all.&rdquo; I sighed, crossing my arms on the table. &ldquo;He was so mad, it made me feel scared. That he doesn&rsquo;t want to be my friend anymore.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Father nodded thoughtfully while Mother pursed her lips and Philipa frowned. To my surprise, Philipa spoke first. &ldquo;But you like Jonas so much!&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I blinked, then laughed a little. &ldquo;Haha, yeah, I know! I guess I just&hellip; don&rsquo;t want to flirt&ndash;&rdquo; I caught myself that time! &ldquo;Sorry, <em>hurt</em> him.&rdquo; I smiled at my little sister, and she smiled back after thinking about what I&rsquo;d said. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;I see what you mean, Asher.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s so better than I am aboutlanguage, it&rsquo;s a wonder we were even put in the same Family Unit. She added &ldquo;Next time you shouldn&rsquo;t do whatever made him upset&rdquo; and nodded, satisfied. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Mother nodded as well, smiling as she said &ldquo;Very good, Philipa! Yes, Asher, whatever you did to upset Jonas, you should apologize and avoid doing it again. What was it?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I gulped, but braced myself to bend the truth a little. &ldquo;I&hellip; um, talked with the Reciever and didn&rsquo;t tell him.&rdquo; My little sister didn&rsquo;t seem to understand, but Mother and Father&rsquo;s mouths fell open in shock. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Father was the first to respond &ldquo;You did what, Asher?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I stammered a little, but I managed to say &ldquo;I-it was the other day, at Assignment training&mdash;the Receiever happened to stop by my department?&rdquo; Quickly, I tried to change the topic. &ldquo;Anyway, it was only a brief talk. We didn&rsquo;t even talk about Jonas&rdquo; which was true. We&rsquo;d just talked about me, actually. That seemed to calm them down, and they breathed a sign of relief. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Eventually, Mother said &ldquo;Well, it sounds like you should follow Philipa&rsquo;s advice, Ash&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk to the Receiver again.&rdquo; I blinked in confusion; that wasn&rsquo;t what her advice had seemed to be to me. She continued &ldquo;After all, the Receiver is the most honored member of the Community, and I doubt he has the time to engage in polite conversation.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Father nodded, agreeing with her. &ldquo;Indeed. And you know how difficult people can find conversing with you, Asher; it would be far more respectful not to speak with him.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I frowned, confused: when we had talked I had apologized repeatedly for talking too much, but the Receiver had seemed genuine about listening to what I had to say. &ldquo;But he liked talking to me!&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Mother and Father sighed, and Father said slowly &ldquo;Asher, how many times must we tell you? Just because people allow you to speak does not nessessarily mean they want to hear what you have to say.&rdquo; Oh, right&mdash;I&rsquo;d heard that plenty of times when I was a child. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I felt my shoulders sag a bit anyway; suddenly I didn&rsquo;t want to talk to my Family Unit anymore. I nodded. &ldquo;Thank you for your help, I&rsquo;ll do that.&rdquo; It was the biggest lie I told that night. As I went to bed, I thought about what I was going to do now. I was certainly <em>not</em> going to just give up&mdash;even though Jonas was upset, I was sure I could get him to see why training with him would be a good thing. Briefly, I wondered if I should have told my Family Unit about my idea, but I thought better of it. Mother and Father would never think it was good, but if the most respected member of the Community gave his explicit approval? I was certain they wouldn&rsquo;t object. Jonas was trickier, though; I needed to learn why exactly he had gotten so upset. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">~~~ </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I made extra sure to take my pill today; drowning in even <em>more</em> Jonas feelings when I tried to talk to him today wouldn&rsquo;t be fun. Today he got to my Dwelling first, and we rode off together toward school, Philipa clearly jealous of our bikes. Eventually, when we were out of sight of my sister, I slowed down. &ldquo;Jonas&hellip;&rdquo; He nodded, looking toward me as best he could while still pedaling. &ldquo;Why were you so upset yesterday? About me talking to the Receiver?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">To my surprise, he actually laughed a little. &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s one way to bring up the subject.&rdquo; He then stopped his bike, and got off it so he was walking instead. I did the same as he continued. &ldquo;Asher, I need you to understand what <em>exactly</em> being a Receiver is.&rdquo; He said, mostly to himself &ldquo;Setting aside the fact that we actually don&rsquo;t know if there <em>can</em> be more than one Receiver, espescially not one that already has an Assignment of their own.... What are the qualities a Receiver of Memory needs?&rdquo; He looked at me expectantly, then. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;Uh.&rdquo; I blinked, uncertainly. The Receiver hadn&rsquo;t mentioned that&hellip; I shrugged, and told the truth. &ldquo;I apologize for not knowing, Jonas.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He waved a dismissive hand, saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. Anyway, when I was first selected, the Elder listed four attributes a Receiver needs.&rdquo; He began holding up a finger for each trait he listed. &ldquo;Intelligence, integrity, courage, and wisdom are the main four. The unofficial fifth is Sensing Beyond.&rdquo; He raised an eyebrow at me. &ldquo;Have you ever experienced something like that?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I blinked, automatically saying &ldquo;I have absolutely no ideal what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; He laughed, which kind of made it worth it. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Recovering, he said &ldquo;Well, I started to See Beyond when I was a Twelve. The current Receiver began Hearing Beyond when he was young, too.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I cut in, saying &ldquo;Can you explain what happened? Maybe I <em>have</em> had something like it&hellip; you&rsquo;re better at describing things, though.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He blinked, but shrugged. &ldquo;Well, the first time I Saw Beyond, you were actually with me, Asher. We were tossing an apple back and forth one day, and it&hellip;&rdquo; he stopped, looking up at the sky for a moment before continuing in a far-off voice. &ldquo;It <em>changed</em>. The apple, that is&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t change size, or shape. But it was&hellip; it was like everything was in shadow, but the apple had briefly passed through a beam of light.&rdquo; He paused, then frowned, adding &ldquo;Except&hellip; different.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I groaned, feeling my shoulders slump. &ldquo;Aw, now I&rsquo;m even <em>more</em> confused!&rdquo; I sighed. I had definitely never had anything like that happen to me before. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Jonas laughed softly, patting my shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Ash&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think anybody else in the Community can, either.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I perked up, adding &ldquo;Well, what about the other three? Um. Intelligence, integration, encourage and wisdom?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;Integrity and courage, but yeah. Essentially, you need to be smart, honest, brave, and wise.&rdquo; I nodded, worried now. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;Well&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know about being smart, but I can defiantly do the other two.&rdquo; Jonas frowned at me. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;What are you talking about, Ash? Of course you&rsquo;re smart!&rdquo; I shook my head. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;Aw come on, I still mess up every little thing I say, and I only ever get okay scores in school. Nothing like yours, anyway.&rdquo; We arrived at the school building, and parked our bikes in the appropriate ports while we talked. I averted my eyes from Jonas&rsquo; as I brought up how much smarter he is than me&mdash;really, it&rsquo;s amazing he likes talking to me at all. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;Intelligence is more than school, Ash!&rdquo; We leaned against a wall on the outside of the building, watching as students began showing up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re great at reading people, and you love making people laugh&mdash;plus, you&rsquo;re good at it.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;I&hellip; suppose.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t really agree, but I was trying to convince him I could be a Receiver; pointing out how I wasn&rsquo;t good wouldn&rsquo;t help me. &ldquo;Well, what about courage? If it&rsquo;s for you, I can be brave.&rdquo; I could tell he tried to frown, but it looked like he was smiling at the same time. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;You&hellip; Ash, you&hellip;&rdquo; he pulled himself together, and continued &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re saying, okay?&rdquo; His face turned pained, and he looked away. &ldquo;The pain I&rsquo;ve experienced&hellip; if you were hurt that way, I, just&hellip; I could never.&rdquo; I laid a hand on his shoulder, and he looked up at the contact, but smiled slightly. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I took a deep breath&mdash;this was the reason, and my chance to convince him. &ldquo;But Jonas, you&rsquo;re the only one who has all that pain, apart from the current Receiver. And he won&rsquo;t be around forever, right?&rdquo; Jonas sighed, shaking his head as he turned to look at the ground. &ldquo;I know, maybe I&rsquo;m not the best, um, choice. But I want to make you happy; and&hellip;&rdquo; I slid closer to him, wrapping my arms around his neck. He looked shocked as I continued, much quieter as I pressed my forehead against his &ldquo;and I think <em>this</em>, whatever it is&hellip; will help make you happy.&rdquo; Even though I&rsquo;d taken my pill, I could feel the echoes of the Stirrings run through my body, and I shivered slightly. The light-picture came up again as I kept going. &ldquo;You said that I could get Released for doing this with you, right?&rdquo; He nodded, not saying anything. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t be Released. Because you&rsquo;re the Receiver, right?&rdquo; Another nod, but this time he was scanning me intently, and pulling away slightly. I stepped back too, smiling as I told him my idea. &ldquo;So, if I&rsquo;m a Receiver too, then we can keep doing that snuff, since I won&rsquo;t be Released for it!&rdquo; I crossed my arms proudly and nodded firmly, happy with what I&rsquo;d said. It seemed pretty simple to me. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">The doors to the school opened up after that, and everybody began streaming into the building. Jonas was staring open-mouthed for a few minutes before we both went inside. &ldquo;B-b-but, Ash, it&rsquo;s not that simple! You don&rsquo;t even understand what you&rsquo;re offering to do!&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I squirmed a little; he had a point. &ldquo;I know, I know&hellip; but you&rsquo;ll be there, too, so it won&rsquo;t be so bad.&rdquo; Even if whatever it was involved pain beyond any I could imagine, Jonas had gone through it too and he&rsquo;d be there. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I grinned at him, but he just looked at me kind of scaredly. &ldquo;Ash, you just don&rsquo;t get it!&rdquo; He rushed ahead and put his hands on my shoulders to stop me walking. &ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m beg&mdash;asking you <em>not</em> to do this. You don&rsquo;t need to, what&rsquo;s the whole point!?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="text-align: center; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">~~~ </p>
<p style="text-align: center; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">~~~ </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">But together, we were trying to piece together what rules we could from the Memories of nerve-wracking first concerts, massive orchestral operas, and friends staying up late together to write songs about ninjas having sex. Still not sure what &lsquo;ninjas&rsquo; are, but the togetherness of the friends of that memory and the accomplishment of finishing their goal made it one of my favorites. As I showered, I thought about the Memories in general. It never failed to amaze me just how diverse they were; the perspectives from which they were viewed, the cultures they took place in, their emotional cores&mdash;there were so few threads tying any of them together, but they all formed this&hellip; beautiful, painful, vivid whole that I had only scratched the surface of. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">One day I had been worried, and the Giver, naturally, picked up on my nerves pretty quickly in the Anexx room. &ldquo;You seem troubled, today, Jonas&mdash;is there anything you&rsquo;d like to talk about?&rdquo; I always appreciate his respect for my privacy; though I do usually prefer to talk about it (since it&rsquo;s almost always something I can&rsquo;t talk about with anyone else), knowing that I have a choice in whether to tell him is always comforting. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I chuckled, saying &ldquo;You know me too well!&rdquo; We shared a small laugh before I began explaining. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just&hellip; worried.&rdquo; I bit my lip, considering how best to word it so I wasn&rsquo;t blaming him&mdash;I just wanted an explanation for why he&rsquo;d lately been transferring multiple memories to me at once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been Receiving so many memories that I&rsquo;m just wondering&hellip; well&hellip; when will I be done? When will&hellip; when will you leave?&rdquo; I looked at him fearfully, adding &ldquo;When will I be alone?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He nodded slowly&mdash;he understood&mdash;but smiled as he replied &ldquo;Well, I suppose you&rsquo;re right, I should probably explain; though know this, Jonas&mdash;we will not be done soon.&rdquo; He smiled a little ruefully, adding &ldquo;In fact, we&rsquo;ve barely even made a dent in the bulk of the Memories.&rdquo; My jaw dropped at that&mdash;seriously!? I&rsquo;d been Receiving memories almost non-stop since I became a Twelve and it was hardly enough to make a measly dent?? The Giver laughed a little at my expression, but he gave a sympathetic nod. &ldquo;Believe me, Jonas, I understand your frustrations. And I don&rsquo;t want you to think that this is a failure on your part&mdash;you have been working very hard, Jonas, and you&rsquo;ve come very far.&rdquo; He gave me a proud smile before gesturing to the musical instruments the Giver and I had been attempting to manufacture in absence of the real thing. &ldquo;Without you, I would have never thought to try to create my own Memories, as you so eloquently put it.&rdquo; I felt a rush of pride at the praise and a slight squirming discomfort at being singled out. Still, the discomfort at being &lsquo;special&rsquo; was slowly fading away as I got used to it&mdash;going from being one of the most ordinary citizens of the Community to being one of the most respected (and, I think to some degree, feared) was a jarring change that I was slow to get a handle on. Continuing with what I thought was a somewhat admiring tone, the Giver said &ldquo;Your artwork <strong>inspired</strong> me; and you need to remember that that <em>matters</em>, Jonas. Perhaps just as much as the Memories themselves.&rdquo; He took a deep breath before continuing almost apologetically &ldquo;With that in mind, you and I have a <em>very</em> long way to go before you even have half of the memories. They&rsquo;re rather&hellip; nebulous, after all, difficult to quantify&rdquo; I nodded in understanding. As I gained more and more Memories and began accessing them on a regular basis, they&rsquo;d begun acting like my own memories, to the point where it was often difficult to tell what was mine and what was not if there wasn&rsquo;t something obvious like an animal or people I didn&rsquo;t know. He continued &ldquo;So I can&rsquo;t say exactly how many memories you have left, nor how many you&rsquo;ve Received. But&hellip; it&rsquo;s not much. Percentage wise, you&rsquo;ve probably Received about&hellip; one percent, perhaps less.&rdquo; I grimaced in sympathy; the Memories I had already felt so heavy on my mind&mdash;I could just imagine how difficult it was for the Giver. Holding up a finger, he added &ldquo;But! I have not just been giving you Memories so slowly for no reason. What I have been focusing on has been giving you a wide foundation to build upon, a framework into which you can place the rest of the Memories I have to give you quickly.&rdquo; Nodding to the books, he said &ldquo;One of those books&mdash;it&rsquo;s the thicker tome near the bottom&mdash;is a scientific study of the human mind and how it works.&rdquo; Science had been a recent addition to my repertoire of knowledge, one that interested me somewhat, but not much. I found the Memories about art and music and people far more fascinating, though I could still appreciate the importance science had. Possibly still now, even in the Community. After all, somebody had somehow managed to turn Fiona&rsquo;s hair into a flat grey&mdash;such knowledge had obviously not been thrown out utterly, though the apparent thirst for better understanding that people in the Memories thought was a key part of humanity was a liability that the Community couldn&rsquo;t tolerate. The Giver continued &ldquo;You understand by now that each Memory is important on its own&mdash;that each is beautiful and unique and important, correct?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I nodded, automatically saying &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; He gave a smile and nod of approval. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&ldquo;Then, you might be surprised to hear me say that I have been attempting to build you a framework for sorting the Memories&mdash;of categorizing them according to what type of wisdom they offer, how to navigate through them with a colder eye so you can recall what they teach without experiencing them, how to link them together to form chains of understanding.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I frowned. Now that he explained it like that, it did seem odd; each of the memories were so&hellip; unquantifiable. Like a small world unto itself. How could things that are so unique be filed away in the Hall of Open Records like a list of the week&rsquo;s food deliveries? &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that take away their power?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">The Giver gave an uncertain shrug. &ldquo;In a way, yes. But it&rsquo;s still a very useful tool&mdash;after all, if somebody asks you a question, you don&rsquo;t want them to standing in front of you for two hours while you rifle through Memories trying to find&rdquo; Here he added some air-quotes &ldquo; &lsquo;that one with the man in the blue shirt sipping a drink on a beach&rsquo;, because you can&rsquo;t quite remember what the message of the Memory was, only that it gave an excellent example of why allowing children to ride bikes younger would be better.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I tilted my head in confusion. &ldquo;But&hellip; usually when I think of a Memory, it&rsquo;s right there, and I can&hellip; well, feel it instantly, no matter what.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">He nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true in the early days, but as you build up more and more Memories, you&rsquo;re eventually going to have so many, with so many different lessons and conflicting viewpoints and emotional cores and even small details that you latch on to despite those elements not necessarily linking to the core of the Memory, that you&rsquo;ll need a system for navigating them quickly and efficiently.&rdquo; He shrugged awkwardly, adding &ldquo;Besides, if you continued to Receive at the rate you have been into the future, it would take us at least ninety-nine more years for me to successfully transfer them; and you need to have every one by the time I&rsquo;m transferred to the House of the Old.&rdquo; I gulped&mdash;fair point. &ldquo;Now your training is going to shift focus&mdash;because you already have a good breadth of understanding, now we need to add depth. And I plan on doing this by giving you large numbers of Memories in one sitting.&rdquo; He raised his eyebrows, adding as an aside &ldquo;If you have anything to say about my methods, let me know, of course.&rdquo; I nodded, but waved a hand to indicate he should continue. &ldquo;Alright then, I&rsquo;d like to start out using music as an example&mdash;&rdquo; I smirked at him knowingly, trying (and failing) to raise only one eyebrow, and he laughed &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m bias or anything! But music is a good starting point&mdash;it only uses one sense, and since auditory sensory input tends not to be as overwhelming as visual stimulai. And there&rsquo;s a very wide variety, so you&rsquo;ll be able to practice Receiving it and sorting through it on your own.&rdquo; That didn&rsquo;t make much sense to me, but I nodded as I began removing my tunic&mdash;it sounded like something I would understand by nature of the exercise. As we moved automatically into our typical positions, he added &ldquo;Now, keep in mind that, for some I&rsquo;m not going to be giving you the entire Memory. Those are mostly Memories of expriences that included music, but were not nessessarily the full focus, such as attending dances; but they might have fragments of extra things on the fringes where you can tell you don&rsquo;t have the whole picture.&rdquo; I nodded again against the plush couch. &ldquo;Alright, here goes. Are you ready, Jonas?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I took a deep breath, closing my eyes. &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo; I entered the relaxed state of Receiving, and felt the Giver&rsquo;s hands on my back and the Memory began flowing into me. My consciousness entered the Memory of what was clearly a song, but that had beeps and boops rather than the instruments in the songs the Giver had shown me. But a few seconds in, I sensed another Memory somehow; I switched to that one, this one featuring a twanging string sound quite different from the sounds of the violin and chello from the Giver&rsquo;s songs. But then there was another, now with a voice saying words in an angry fashion that I had almost no time to try and decipher before I sensed yet another Memory. I tried to switch to that one, but now instead of a single additional Memory, it was a block of them. So, my consciousness began to experience them all at once&mdash;they mixed together, blending into a massive carcopheny of voices and noises and sound that lost all meaning as individual experiences. I distantly felt myself grit my teeth to avoid screaming. I could <em>handle</em> this, and I didn&rsquo;t want to make the Giver feel as if he had been too hard on me. </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">Instead of trying to block the wall of noise out, I let it crash over me, deafen the inside of my head with their ringing and clanging and&hellip; squeaking? Huh. It continued for what felt like a long time, but soon I thought I noticed the sound lessening a little. Maybe. A bit later and I was sure it was growing quieter&mdash;the noise died down abruptly, and I could now make out some words being said here and there, though the sounds still clashed more often than not. Soon after that, it became apparent that what had been happening was that the music all had different lengths&mdash;most had stopped by now, and only two were playing. One appeared to be a sad, mournful song that reminded me of the first song the Giver had Given me&mdash;he&rsquo;d called it &lsquo;opera&rsquo;. It was hard to tell over the second one left, which ended up being longer than the first. This was composed mostly of angry-sounding crashes, screeching noises, and what I could swear was a person screaming. After even it had ceased its mad tune, I took a breath and opened my eyes to stare at the wall my head had been turned toward when I laid down for a few seconds. &ldquo;Well? What do you think?&rdquo; the Giver&rsquo;s voice cut through my stunned staring, which made me flick my gaze up to him. Evidently, my expression said everything, because he nodded, letting air out between his teeth. &ldquo;I know, it&rsquo;s a little overwhelming at first!&rdquo; I laughed, exhaling hard as I pushed myself back up and he added &ldquo;But you get used to it.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I shook my head, rubbing it as I recalled the intensity of the first couple of&hellip; moments? &ldquo;How&mdash;how long were they?&rdquo; The Giver shifted back so we could resume conversation and I added &ldquo;I mean, they were obviously different lengths&hellip; but how long were most of them?&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">His eyebrows shot up. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s impressive, Jonas&mdash;I sure didn&rsquo;t notice something like that my first time receiving twelve Memories at once!&rdquo; Twelve. Wow&hellip; just twelve? Continuing his explanation, added &ldquo;The shortest one was about two minutes and thirty seconds long, and the longest was&hellip;&rdquo; he consulted his own copy of the Memory &ldquo;Just shy of five minutes.&rdquo; </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">I let out a breath as I looked down at my lap &ldquo;Gosh, felt like forever.&rdquo;  </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&nbsp;all these years you&rsquo;ve spent are not being wasted simply because you do not have a large number of Memories;&nbsp;  </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">4380 / 7 000 000 000 (aprox number of people alive right now) =~ 6.257e-7 % = 0.00000006257 % </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">70 000 000 000 (the approximate number of people who&rsquo;ve existed since now) / 4380 (about how many memories Received by age 16, assuming 365 days a year with 4 received per day) =~ 6.257e-8 % (value aprox) = 0.000000006257 % </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 29.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif;">&nbsp; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >I was so excited! Today was the day that I was going to really test my idea. I was a little scarred too, but it would be okay; Jonas was going with me, after all. The first problem we had to try and solve was that there simply wasn&rsquo;t a time to go to the administrative offices. Eventually Jonas suguested I do it while in transit between school and my Assignment training&mdash;&ldquo;You might be a little late, but you can just give an Apology, so it won&rsquo;t seem suspicious.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Which made sense to me&mdash;I was getting better at getting places on time, but I did slip up once in a while. So, after school, Jonas rode with me to the administrative building. We parked our bikes, and I looked up at the tall building and felt my gut churn. &ldquo;The nervous center of the Community&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas gave a soft chuckle. &ldquo;I think you mean &lsquo;nerve&rsquo; center.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Whatever. My nervous center, then.&rdquo; Which made him laugh even more. And that made me feel confident enough to walk through the doors. </p>
<p >Important-looking adults walked purpousfully to and from, all of them way too busy doing important Community things to bother noticing me. But I noticed that a few of them did notice Jonas. Even when I got to the front desk, the female only stopped her writing when she saw Jonas. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She stood, nodding her head in Jonas&rsquo; direction. &ldquo;It is an honor, Receiver of Memory. How can I help you today?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He gave her a smile, but something about it seemed&hellip; stained, or whatever the word is for &lsquo;being really hard to do&rsquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just here helping my friend,&rdquo; and he nodded at me. &ldquo;Recreation Director Asher.&rdquo; </p>
<p >That made me feel very proud. I waved at her. &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; She blinked in surpirse, but gave me a smile as she sat down. </p>
<p >&ldquo;What can I do for you today, Asher?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I opened my mouth, but then closed it and pulled out the piece of paper that I&rsquo;d written down what to say on. I mumbled a quick apology as I re-read it, making sure the words were right in my head before saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to put in a request for selection.&rdquo; Perfect! I nodded to myself and gave her a satisfied smile. </p>
<p >She seemed confused for a second before smiling the &lsquo;percision of language&rsquo; smile people make when I mess up words. &ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;d like to submit a request for &lsquo;re-assignment&rsquo;, Asher?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I shook my head. &ldquo;Nope. I&rsquo;m submitting a request to be selected.&rdquo; After a second, I added, &ldquo;As a Retriever. I mean, Receiver. Of memory.&rdquo; </p>
<p >She looked totally confused. Even when Jonas waved and added, &ldquo;Like me.&rdquo; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >Eventually we were handed a form that was tilted &lsquo;Official Request for Re-Assignment&rsquo;. I frowned at the wording, turning to Jonas as he read the top of the form. &ldquo;So much for my attempt at &lsquo;percussion of language&rsquo;.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas gave a quick snort at that, but then glanced up at me, confused. &ldquo;&lsquo;Percussion&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Oh, drat! &ldquo;I apologize for use of inccorect wording, I meant &lsquo;precision&rsquo; of language.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas frowned, saying absently, &ldquo;I accept your apology, Asher&mdash;but, do you know what that word means? &lsquo;Percussion&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I thought about it for a second. &ldquo;Per-cush-in?&rdquo; I shook my head, shrugging and turning back to the paper. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so. I always say stuff wrong, so most of it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&rdquo; The first few blank spaces were easy, of course. My name (Asher, obliviously), whether I was male or female (male), my status in the Community (adult-in-training), my Assignment Title (Recreation Director). Then, it got difficult. The last section was just a few lines under the question &lsquo;Why do you believe you are unsuited to your current assignment?&rsquo; </p>
<p >With Jonas&rsquo; help, I came up with this: </p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><u> I do not believe I am unsuited for my current assignment&mdash;I would like to take on some of the responsibilities of the Reciever of Memory. I believe I have the nessessary intelligence, integrity, and courage to be a great help to the current Reciever of Memory, and to Jonas when he becomes the Reciever of Memory himself. </u></p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >I stopped by every day and asked the person at the desk whether my form had been processed and if the Elders had read it yet. I wanted to know as soon as they did, in case I needed to explain what it meant to them&mdash;it was a little confusing, after all. But days passed, and still no word. Days became weeks, and the people in the building began to really notice me every day. I&rsquo;d wake to them when they greeted me, but I left dissapointed every day. </p>
<p >Eventually, it was a month later and I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. &ldquo;How long will it be until they look at it?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Janice gave me a patient, soft smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t know, Asher&mdash;every case is unique, after all, and yours is, um. A special case.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I couldn&rsquo;t tell what she meant by that. &ldquo;But&hellip; but how long does it usually take?&rdquo; </p>
<p >She turned back to her paperwork. &ldquo;The average length between processing and a hearing being called is around five years&hellip;&rdquo; My jaw dropped open&mdash;five <strong><em>years</em></strong>!? I couldn&rsquo;t wait that long! I was almost going crazy with couriousity about that feeling, but Jonas had said it only made sense to do it if I actually succeded. She wasn&rsquo;t done, though. &ldquo;&hellip;but for special cases, I think it tends to take a decade or more.&rdquo; </p>
<p >D-decades!? I couldn&rsquo;t even wrap my head around so much time&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t even been <em>alive</em> for two decades! For the first time, I felt a little bit of doubt about this. What if they said no, after all? What about my work as Recreation Director? What about my family unit? What about Jonas? Jonas&hellip; my chest started to feel weird when I thought about Jonas, remembering him talking about how much painful stuff he&rsquo;d seen. Remembring how terrified he&rsquo;d looked when they called him up after the Ceremony of Twelve, alone. I knew what that felt like, it&rsquo;s the fear I would get when I slipped up with my language when I was a Five or Six. Every time it was like a sudden wave of terror would flood me and I couldn&rsquo;t apologize fast enough. </p>
<p >I blinked as my vision became blurry and I started doing the &lsquo;sad gasps&rsquo; thing again. Janice looked up at me in surprise, and then&hellip; maybe a little bit of fear? Quickly, I rubbed the water from my eyes and tried to stop it. &ldquo;I-I apolog-gize for starting you, Janice! I d-didn&rsquo;t, mean&mdash;I just, I&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo; As is always the case, the words tangled up and jumbled together in such a knot even I didn&rsquo;t know what I was trying to say. I could feel eyes on me as I let out a few more gasps. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Do you need pain relief, Asher? Is something wrong?&rdquo; She was looking at me really worridly. </p>
<p >I shook my head. &ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;m okay, I just&mdash;please, can you&hellip; can you ask them to look at my form?&rdquo; I took a deep breath, steadying my breathing. The gasping had stopped, at least. &ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think I can wait that long.&rdquo; </p>
<p >She was looking at me like I was from a whole other Community. &ldquo;I&hellip; the Elders look at the forms when they want, I can&rsquo;t influence their decisions.&rdquo; </p>
<p >It was the first time I really felt trapped. </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >&ldquo;I mean, I <em>just</em> want them to look at it so I can explain what I mean! Is that so much to ask!?&rdquo; I was doing Feelings, kind of, with Jonas as we walked our bikes to his training. I&rsquo;d done the sad-gasps thing a couple days ago, and I&rsquo;d thought about it and decided that I was more mad than anything. Was I really asking too much? </p>
<p >Jonas, however, was calm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking for a break in routine. The Community only functions so well because there&rsquo;s so little difference in what happens.&rdquo; He nodded to a couple of passing food deliverers. &ldquo;Everybody is so used to things going a specific way that doing anything new is almost terrifying for them.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Oh. I guess&hellip;&rdquo; Hm. Now that I thought about it&hellip; &ldquo;Hey, Jonas; the Receiver of Memory is an Elder, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He looked at me like he thought I was up to something. &ldquo;Yes&hellip; why?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I bit my lip, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but voice my idea. &ldquo;What if&hellip; what if you specifically&lt;tragically&gt; asked him to look at my form?&rdquo; Jonas&rsquo; eyes widened and I added quickly, &ldquo;When I asked the person at the front desk she said she couldn&rsquo;t influence the Elders and what they do and I don&rsquo;t want you to get him to do it or anything but could you just mention it to him at least? I can&rsquo;t wait ten years! I&ndash;&rdquo; I swallowed, looked away from Jonas&rsquo; eyes, his beautiful, deep, eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just too long. Please, Jonas&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m not sure he&rsquo;ll even be able to do anything, but I&rsquo;ll mention it to him.&rdquo; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >Another month went by and I got more used to the weird ache I felt when Jonas and I were together. I still asked the person at the desk about the forms every day, but I didn&rsquo;t feel kept down when she said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, anymore. In fact, she started apologizing every time I got the news I didn&rsquo;t want, which made me feel at least like she cared. </p>
<p >But what kept me going was how sure I was that this was right&mdash;I could feel a lack of&hellip; something, and I knew jonas was part of that. And being with him? That felt right. </p>
<p >Something funny happened with Jonas&mdash;and not the &lsquo;playing games with your friends&rsquo; kind of funny, the &lsquo;not sure if this is rude or not&rsquo; funny. Not that it was <em>bad</em> or anything, just that I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should ask him or not. But he would touch me, in ways that I could tell would&rsquo;ve made the Stirrings go wild if I hadn&rsquo;t been takig my pill. Even without it, it difinitively made me feel good, like he wanted to feel the same way, had be not been taking the pills too. He&rsquo;d also been talking about his job! Well&hellip; not really? More like he had been saying stuff like &ldquo;Yes, that reminds me of something in a training session from a few months ago&rdquo; or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rather paltry compared to something from my training.&rdquo; </p>
<p >It was so strange, since before he&rsquo;d never even talk much if he could help it. One day I decided to try and ask about it. &ldquo;Jonas, I apologize in advancement for any rudeness   that may result from a question I want to ask you. You are a highely esteemed member of the Community and as such deserve the highest amount of steam!&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas smiled his sad smile. &ldquo;I get plenty of hot air from everybody, Ash&mdash;you don&rsquo;t need to worry about that.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I groaned! &ldquo;Aw I did it again, didn&rsquo;t I!&rdquo; Jonas didn&rsquo;t look upset but I recited an apology without thinking about it. &ldquo;I apologize for my poor position of language, I meant &lsquo;esteem&rsquo;.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas sighed. &ldquo;I told you, Ash, you don&rsquo;t need to apologize to me. But I do accept your apology. What&rsquo;s your question?&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you talk about what you actually&hellip; do in your training?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He didn&rsquo;t say anything for a few moments. Then he looked away and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; not allowed to discuss my training with anybody, Ash.&rdquo; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >It was a lot harder for me than it was for Jonas. The first time I tried, uh, Receiving, I guess, it took <em>forever</em>. I never even managed to get the&hellip; memory or whatever it was. Or, I did, but it wasn&rsquo;t much. I was lying face-down on the couch in the room. &ldquo;It&hellip; I can see some sort of, like, mound? And there was all this&hellip; dust everywhere?&rdquo; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >Everything felt a little weird when the door finally clicked shut and Jonas and I were alone. It was the first time we&rsquo;d ever been alone together, for as long as we wanted. He looked at me. I looked at him. </p>
<p >We stayed that way for a while. </p>
<p >Eventually, I coughed. &ldquo;So, um. Do you&hellip;&rdquo; I glanced around&mdash;right now was designated free time for Childless Adults, so there wasn&rsquo;t anything we <em>had</em> to do, like eat. &ldquo;&hellip;want&hellip; to&hellip; talk?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas shrugged. &ldquo;Sure, what&rsquo;s on your mind, Ash?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I actually did have something I wanted to talk to him about. &ldquo;So, you know how in the Memories, there&rsquo;re games you play as a kid that involve songs?&rdquo; Then I spent the next hour or so talking about game ideas I&rsquo;ve been having thanks to the Memories I&rsquo;ve received. It&rsquo;s not a lot, apparently&mdash;but I have a much harder time Receiving than Jonas does, and I don&rsquo;t do it as often as he does, so there&rsquo;s not much we can do to get more Memories in me. </p>
<p >By then it was late, and Jonas and I had scooted our chairs so we were much closer together. At some point I accidentally wedged him in the face with my hand when I was gesturing. &ldquo;Oh, sorry!&rdquo; </p>
<p >He waited it off. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing Ash.&rdquo; </p>
<p >Eventually we ended up in the bedroom, and I started feeling nervous&mdash;which wasn&rsquo;t usually how I felt about Jonas. I hadn&rsquo;t Received any Memories about it yet, but Jonas had explained that the &lsquo;Stirrings&rsquo; were related to sex, which was about reproduction in the time before. It was all a little odd to me, but he further explained that it was the reason behind the &lsquo;always apologize for seeing nudity&rsquo; rule, and why it was waived for the very young and the Old. I didn&rsquo;t get it, but I did get why that would be such a hard thing to deal with. I could feel it now, as Jonas and I got ready for bed. When we were done, he cleared his throat. &ldquo;So&hellip; do you&hellip; want to sleep in the same bed as me?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I blinked at him. &ldquo;you can <em>do</em> that?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He smiled cockily. &ldquo;<em>We</em> can.&rdquo; </p>
<p >So we did. &lt;expand&gt; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >Touching him while trying to sleep was fun, but it made it really hard to get to sleep. Over the next few weeks I got used to it, and even started to like it! He was just so <em>warm</em> in my arms, and being so close to him let me notice stuff I&rsquo;d never have noticed otherwise&mdash;like how he smells? Which I can&rsquo;t really describe, but I felt it. Like with the few &lsquo;songs&rsquo; I&rsquo;d Received&mdash;there just wasn&rsquo;t any word for it. And if there was, II probably would&rsquo;ve messed it up. </p>
<p >One night, I got in bed before Jonas and waited for him&mdash;he liked my warmth, too, and it was warmer if the other person got in before the other. But when he got in, he climbed on top of me. I blinked as he gripped me by the shoulder and pushed me into the bed. He let out a breath and said, &ldquo;Ash&hellip; I&hellip; I really, <em>really</em> want to kiss you.&rdquo; </p>
<p >&ldquo;Uh&hellip; sure, that&rsquo;s okay, Jonas.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t sure what a &lsquo;kiss&rsquo; actually <em>was</em>, but I trust Jonas. He looked really unsusre, so I pushed myself up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, just show me.&rdquo; We were really close now&mdash;the Stirrings felt distant and mutated, but I still relished the feeling. Then he pressed his mouth against mine. It made me remember how this had happened a few months ago, too, and how my body had been flooded with tingling feelings that time. </p>
<p >It wasn&rsquo;t quite like that time, but as Jonas kept his mouth on mine and started moving his lips, I still taught my grip on the sheets. It felt&hellip; good, but so <em>weird</em>! Part of that was how weird this would&rsquo;ve looked to anybody else, but I&rsquo;d been getting much better at shoveling that feeling away lately. Mostly, it was how much longer it lasted. It felt like a long time, but this time I knew it lasted much longer; so eventually it got kind of&hellip;boring, almost? Instead, I started focusing on what else of jonas I could touch. </p>
<p >I wasn&rsquo;t sure how he&rsquo;d feel about it, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about that at the moment. That indulgeance control again, I guess! My hands felt really comfortable on his waist, but when I squeezed his skin a little he kind of&hellip; did this kind of smooth shake? With his hips. Then he started nibbling my lower lip, and you&rsquo;d think that would be weird, but it actually felt pretty great! I let out a breath I hadn&rsquo;t known I was holding in, and I could feel jonas smile. He said quietly, &ldquo;does that feel good?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I whispered back, &ldquo;yeah, it feels great&hellip;&rdquo; I let my motormouth keep going&mdash;because I was a little nervous and it helped to say stuff out loud. &ldquo;I never&mdash;&ldquo; he interrupted me with a small lick on my lips. &ldquo;&mdash;though about&mdash;&ldquo; another, and he started moving my hands around too. &ldquo;&mdash;what your body&rsquo;s like, it&rsquo;s do different to mine!&rdquo; Jonas felt softer, squishier&mdash;my body was much&hellip; thicker than his, I guess. Maybe I have more muscles? </p>
<p >He was so close now that I was lying back down again while he started moving his mouth and lips even more and that got really distracting. Now he started swiping his tongue over my lips and teeth and it was pretty good, all while i started moving my hands over his tunic, trying to feel the body underneath. Weird how I&rsquo;d never really thought about just how much clothing covers. Then Jonas moved hia mouth from my mouth to right by my ear and whispered, &ldquo;can you open your mouth?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Oh! I nodded, whispering back, &ldquo;yeah, sure!&rdquo; I opened my mouth wide, complete with the&nbsp; &ldquo;Aahhhh&rdquo; doctors always ask for in medical checkups. </p>
<p >He paused before laughing awkwardly. &ldquo;No Ash, I mean&hellip;&rdquo; he paused, and even though the lights had gone out for the night, I could just sense his &lsquo;person of labguage&rsquo; face. Then he leaned closer and mumered &lt;new word?&gt;, &ldquo;like <em>this</em>,&rdquo; before pressing his mouth onto mine and, oh, I could feel what he meant&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t opening his mouth as wide as I was. I mimed what he was doing and a few seconds later his <em>tongue</em> was in my <em>mouth</em>. </p>
<p >And it wasn&rsquo;t nearly as gross as I&rsquo;d have expected it would be. Sure it was slimy, but half of that was me. What surprised me most was how soft it felt&hellip; almost like a Comfort Object, if they&rsquo;d made one with&hellip; applesause and rubber instead of fluff and fabric. I could feel a ghost of the tingling from the Stirrings hover just out of reach, and no matter how hard I tried I couldn&rsquo;t feel the same exhilkerafing rush as before. So I tried to focus on enjoying it for what it was; he did all kinds of crazy stuff with his lips and tongue, stuff like brushing his tongue against the roof of my mouth and sucking my tongue in his mouth, and I was sure that if my mouth hadn&rsquo;t been full of Jonas, I&rsquo;d have been babbling like crazy. </p>
<p >By the time he pulled away, we were both panting and I finally noticed that i&rsquo;d somehow ended up grabbing the back of Jonas&rsquo;s head and his arms were wrapped around my neck. In the faint glow of the lights-they-keep-on-at-night-in-case-somebody-needs-to-get-up, I could just make out a string of spit still connecting our lips. I let go of his head and dropped my hands to the side as I caught my breath. &ldquo;Wow! What was that called?&rdquo; </p>
<p >Jonas laughed a little as he moved his hands from around my neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard there&rsquo;s a couple of words for it&mdash;making out, snogging, French kissing&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >I cocked my head in confusion as he ran his hands through my hair (which felt good too, yeesh!). &ldquo;Wait, that was kissing?&rdquo; </p>
<p >He nodded. &ldquo;Yes&hellip; you didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; I shook my head. He sighed. &ldquo;Ash, you have to tell me if you don&rsquo;t know something!&rdquo; He moved his hand out of my hair, &ldquo;I might end up hurting you.&rdquo; </p>
<p >That made me laugh! &ldquo;Psh, come on Jonas, you wouldn&rsquo;t ever hurt me!&rdquo; I pulled him down so we were facing each other side-by-side, and I started tucking myself closer to his body. There was something so comforting, knowing he was <em>there</em>. </p>
<p >He signed, and whispered, &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t want to, but I might do it by accident.&rdquo; </p>
<p >I shrugged as I started drifting off. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just tell you then,&rdquo; I yawned before adding, &ldquo;and you can&hellip; stop, or something.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t see what there was to worry about&mdash;we would be fine! </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >It was a couple weeks into our new &lsquo;living arrangement&rsquo; that Jonas said something about the pills. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re those for?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I shrugged as I popped one and gulped it down with our breakfast&rsquo;s glass of milk, &ldquo;Just the Stirring pills,&rdquo; and went back to trying to describe my dream (since Jonas and the Giver were the only people I could tell it to, now). &ldquo;Anyway, you kept throwing Comfort Objects at me as you ran away&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p >This time, Jonas interrupted. &ldquo;Wait, why are you taking those?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I blinked, shrugged. &ldquo;I have to&mdash;I&rsquo;ve already been called out by the Announcer a couple times for forgetting them this year.&rdquo; A hot pit of shame settled in my stomach, but that happens to me all the time. </p>
<p >&ldquo;Ash&hellip; you don&rsquo;t need to take your pills anymore.&rdquo; </p>
<p >~~~ </p>
<p >It turned out that, apparently, the Council wasn&rsquo;t even allowed to look in our house if we turned the speaker off (like in the Giver&rsquo;s room), which meant I could totally skip the pill with immunity! I laughed, &ldquo;Ha, this is so great! I&rsquo;ve always hated taking those stupid things!&rdquo; </p>
<p >I did a small dance I think I&rsquo;d seen in some Memory or another when Jonas sounded surprised. &ldquo;Really? Why?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I nodded as we shouldered our school bags and headed out. &ldquo;Yeah, I had to start them when I was really little, and my Stirrings had already been left untreated for a few months." </p>
<p >Jonas looked shocked.&ldquo;Months? How&rsquo;d you manage that!?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I felt my face heat up with pride and embaressment, though I guess it wasn&rsquo;t scuh a big deal now that Jonas and I had kissed. &ldquo;My parents just didn&rsquo;t get what it meant, I guess. Percisoin of language and all, ya know?&rdquo; He nodded in understanding. I contnued, &ldquo;So I really hated finally having to take them.&rdquo; </p>
