        <p>According to the title of this webpage my name is Fif, and this is my website! Exciting stuff. At time of writing I'm a student of Computer Science at San Francisco State University. On this website you'll find.. some stuff. I've got a page for what you could politely call my "creative writing", and "fanfiction" if you want to be accurate. Perhaps in the future I'll even have a page for CS projects I've made.</p>
        <p>Even more exciting, maybe I'll make it so that the menu for this website is all in one file so I don't need to keep copying and pasting every stingle little change I make into each file! <b>*audience gasps in astonishment*</b></p>
