        <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm Fif Gallagher, a recent Computer Science graduate from San Francisco State University.</p>
        My journey to the tech field wasn't.. obvious. As a kid I wasn't allowed to play video games (my mother predicted I would become addicted to them), and in elementary school I somehow managed to render our blocky desktop computer unresponsive by downloading screensavers. So technology wasn't an obvious career path for me.
        But somethings I /was/ fascinated by as a kid were adjacent to CS. I remember spending many hours shuffling and re-sorting playing cards, trying to figure out how to make the process involve as little effort from me as possible. The process I landed on was to flip through each card one by one and ask a question of each card within that mini-deck:
        <ol>What color is this card?</ol>
        <ol>Which suit?</ol>
        <ol>Is it a face card?</ol>
        <ol>Is it the biggest card?</ol>
        Realizing many years later that I had independently thought of sorting algorithms without knowing what they were was a real joy.

        All this to basically say that I was always fascinated by /systems/. Airports, Rube Goldberg machines, those cutaway diagrams with 3d models of life in middle-age castles... in hindsight, all these interests poised me to love the theoretical side of computer science.

        Making code readable, modular, and scalable are the things I find fascinating. But to me, what's great about computer science is its ability to put complex ideas into a framework not only for discussion, but to make it tangible. That's what I hope to accomplish in my career.

        <p>According to the title of this webpage my name is Fif, and this is my website! Exciting stuff. At time of writing I'm a student of Computer Science at San Francisco State University. On this website you'll find.. some stuff. I've got a page for what you could politely call my "creative writing", and "fanfiction" if you want to be accurate. Perhaps in the future I'll even have a page for CS projects I've made.</p>
        <p>Even more exciting, maybe I'll make it so that the menu for this website is all in one file so I don't need to keep copying and pasting every stingle little change I make into each file! <b>*audience gasps in astonishment*</b></p>
