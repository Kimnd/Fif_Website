<div class="garyBox">
<p  >I felt so groggy. Ugh, I fucking <em>hate</em> that feeling&mdash;I wrenched my eyes open, trying to force my brain to wake up. Fuck, my whole head felt like it was full of lead. I tried to roll onto my side to look around, but as soon as I moved my right hand erupted in white-hot pain that cut straight through the grogginess. I hissed, drawing it to my chest and curling up into a fetal position. The pain died down after a couple seconds, decreasing to a throb that spiked a little when my heart beat. I took a shaky breath, flexing my other hand and, finding it unbroken, propped myself up. </p>
<p  >Sensory input began flooding my mind; the slight whiff of mildew in the olfactory flood of bleach, the distant echoes of screams and crying entering and leaving harmony with the just-audible buzz of the lights in the hallway, the chill that had already seeped into my bones as springs from the mattress dug into me. It was a little more overwhelming than normal, but what was worse was the memories of how I got here. </p>
<p  >I felt my lip curl as I remembered&mdash;<em>Jimmy</em>. That fucker&hellip; he&rsquo;d BEATEN me! </p>
<p  >I started shaking with the desire to scream, or punch somebody; I had been thwarted by a walking muscle with a pair of Goddamn testicles for a brain! Months crafting my empire, carefully laying down every piece of the plan, fucking GONE in an INSTANT! I could still feel the air thrumming with electricity as the moron of the century glared at me in confused anger and shouted, asking why I&rsquo;d done it and I&rsquo;d been happy to explain exactly why as the sweet, sweet feeling of victory coursed through me at how fucking <em>stupid</em> everybody else was and of course he didn&rsquo;t care about how fucking dumb he was how could he <em>possibly</em> understand and ha he was calling <strong>me</strong> a loser now <strong>that&rsquo;s</strong> fucking rich <em>how long has it been raining my clothes are soaked through</em> I knew exactly the right words to really twist the knife before suddenly I was fighting him I just had to hurt him somehow but it wasn&rsquo;t working <em>that crunching in my hand probably wasn&rsquo;t a good sign</em> and then I was tumbling through space as terror overtook my mind before everything went dark. </p>
<p  >A shriek split the buzzing drone of florecent lighting made me flinch&mdash;this time, it wasn&rsquo;t distant. Then, &ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo; shut it!&rdquo; followed by a sharp <em>smack!</em> and a whimper. Footsteps receded into the depths of the building. </p>
<p  >I sat very still for a while, trying to bottle up a new, inexplicable urge to cry. Jesus, like I&rsquo;m fucking <em>Femme Boy</em>. I squeezed my eyes shut, hanging onto that thought&mdash;anything to distract. Petey crying when I punched him for beating me at his dumb video game, screaming when I shoved him off the top of the slide, sniffling pathetically after I&rsquo;d kicked him in the balls this year. I rolled my eyes to myself&mdash;you&rsquo;d think somebody as relatively not-dumb as the others would be able to avoid doing stupid shit, but hey, he&rsquo;s always been crap at avoiding trouble. </p>
<p  >As the hours ticked by, the pit of my stomach bubbled and frothed to the point that I started digging my fingers into the palm of my broken hand to keep myself from screaming or, even worse, crying. I didn&rsquo;t want to upset the guard or undignifiy myself by adding to the insanity soundscape. After all, I had a revenge scheme to hatch. </p>
<p  >Hopkins would fucking   PAY. </p>
<p  >I passed out on my cot on June 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2007. Maybe I couldn&rsquo;t get out, but God as my fucking witness I would drag Jimmy down with me. </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p  >When I finally came back into consciousness, I wasn&rsquo;t sure why I was grateful for the untethered feeling that came with waking up. Usually I hate that feeling&mdash;one of the many reasons I avoid sleeping as much as humanly possible. </p>
<p  >But eventually, reality came rushing back in&mdash;I&rsquo;d had the whole school under my thumb until the King of the Idiots had shown up and fucked it all up and.. fucking hell, I haven&rsquo;t wanted to cry since.. I don&rsquo;t even know. Christ, Petey must&rsquo;ve infected me with something&mdash;soon I&rsquo;ll be sobbing at the drop of a hat. </p>
<p  >Well, enough lying around; time to start planning. Sure, my life might be ruined, but I wasn&rsquo;t about to let <em>that</em> keep me from destroying Hopkins&rsquo; life, too. I sighed, bringing my hand up to rub at my eyes sleepily&mdash;this time I wasn&rsquo;t even starting from square <em>one</em>. I&rsquo;d need to suck up big-time if I wanted to get anywhere. I yawned and stretched my arms out. At least this cot wasn&rsquo;t as uncomfortable as I would&rsquo;ve expected&ndash; </p>
<p  >I snapped my eyes open. My hand was  <em> broken </em>  yesterday  . I pulled it back from my face, taking a closer look. The leather strap on my wrist was there like it always is, and I couldn&rsquo;t feel any pain coming from that hand when I flexed it gingerly. Weird. Had somebody come in and injected it with pain killers or something? I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past this place. Still, probably best to treat it carefully, just to be on the safe side. </p>
<p  >I dropped my hand and closed my eyes, sighing, almost wishing I was full of those drugs from yesterday. Then I&rsquo;d just want to lie here and <em>not</em> think; playing Hopkins for a day didn&rsquo;t sound too bad at this rate. I shook my head and moved to get out of bed, intent on splashing my face with some water to wake up. No rest for the wicke&mdash;I did a double-take when I was finally able to take in my surroundings. </p>
<p  >I wasn&rsquo;t <em>in</em> a dingy, claustrophobic cell. I was in my dorm room. </p>
<p  >I gaped at everything open-mouthed, like somehow that might change what I was seeing. Petey was even asleep on the other side of the room, like everything was totally normal! I sat rooted to the spot for some time, my mind spinning around in circles. At some point, his stupid alarm clock started talking quietly about the local traffic, and he rolled out of bed. His greeting of, &ldquo;Oh, hey Gary&mdash;morning,&rdquo; managed to cut through my swirling vortex of thoughts. I snapped my head to see him yawning and stretching. </p>
<p  >He didn&rsquo;t even glance at me as he padded over to his wardrobe. &hellip;seriously? No reaction at all? &ldquo;..Not surprised to see me, Petey?&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t have forgotten what happened; it&rsquo;s not like <strong>he</strong> was pumped to the gills with sedatives yesterday. </p>
<p  >He cocked his head in confusion as he started pulling his PJs off. &ldquo;Hm? What do you  &mdash;&rdquo;   Here he was interrupted by a large yawn before continuing. &ldquo;&mdash;mean?&rdquo; I tried to not let my annoyance show. </p>
<p  >Jesus Christ, even early in the morning he   can&rsquo;t be <em>this</em> stupid! I got up, moving over to my own wardrobe and affecting a conversational tone, keeping my panic under wraps. &ldquo;  Well  &hellip;&rdquo; I began rifling through my clothes, taking care to use my left hand. &ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve thought you&rsquo;d be surprised to see somebody who got shipped off to the House for Crazies yesterday,&rdquo; I shrugged casually, but kept a careful eye on his   expression. </p>
<p  >Seemed like he was finally waking up, because he turned to face me directly&mdash;but he was more &lsquo;confused&rsquo;, not the &lsquo;terrified&rsquo; I&rsquo;d been expecting. &ldquo;What? Do&hellip; uh.. you mean somebody got put in Happy Volts?&rdquo; His face suddenly shifted to what could best be described as horrified. I smirked; there we go! &ldquo;Wait, you mean a <em>student</em>!?&rdquo;Hm. Guess not. </p>
<p  >Seemed I would have spell it out for him&mdash;just like he needs fucking <em>everything</em> spelled out for him. &ldquo;Wow, Petey, that&rsquo;s pretty mean of you to say!&rdquo; I clutched at my chest and did my best to ignore the cold dread that was still churning in my gut at the fact that I was going to spend the rest of my days locked up. &ldquo;Am I really just &lsquo;a student&rsquo; to you? And here I thought we were <em>friends</em>....&rdquo; I then mock-pouted, fluttering my eyelashes, making sure to enjoy how uncomfortable he looked at the statement. Heh, that never gets old. </p>
<p  >Even so, he recovered soon, oscillating between horror and confusion. &ldquo;Wait, wait&hellip; are you saying <em>you</em> got put in there?&rdquo; I rolled my eyes, automatically reaching out to grab something. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Seriously Femme Boy, even <em>you</em> had to notice the showdown your <em>boyfriend</em> and I ha&ndash; <strong> shit </strong> !  &rdquo; I yanked my hand back as I bumped it against something in the wardrobe. But it hadn&rsquo;t hurt. I frowned, flexing it a little less gingerly now. It felt fine&mdash;and now that I examined it more closely, it really didn&rsquo;t <em>look</em> broken; wouldn&rsquo;t it be discolored or swollen? </p>
<p  >From across the room, Petey groaned at the &lsquo;boyfriend&rsquo;   comment.   &ldquo;Whatever man&mdash;what &lsquo;showdown&rsquo;? Is this about that new kid you&rsquo;ve been talking about?&rdquo; I snapped my gaze to him, but he was too busy tugging his pants on to notice my intense scrutiny. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;what &lsquo;new kid&rsquo;?&rdquo; I returned my attention to my right hand, using the left to press into it. There had to be <em>something</em> wrong with it&mdash;it had been so painful yesterday. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;You know, um.. Jamey? Timmy?&rdquo; I turned my head toward him very slowly. How could he have forgotten Hopkins&rsquo;   name  !  ?   He snapped his fingers a couple of times before saying &ldquo;Oh, was it Jimmy?&rdquo; and looking over at me expectantly as he buttoned up his stupid, girly shirt. </p>
<p  >I was having an increasingly difficult time hiding my confusion. I only just managed to maintain a deadpan tone for my next line. &ldquo;Yes. Jimmy. Jimmy Hopkins.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I turned back to my wardrobe, grabbing my usual school uniform automatically as a buzzing noise began to fill my head. Using my right hand didn&rsquo;t   hurt at all  &mdash;dressing helped me try and sort out my thoughts. One: my hand was broken yesterday, and today it wasn&rsquo;t. Two: I went to bed in a fucking insanity asylum yesterday and today I woke up at school. Three: yesterday, Hopkins was the&ndash;here I paused to shudder&ndash;king of the school, and today not even Moron Lover Kowalski knows who he is. But what the hell did it all mean? </p>
<p  >An innocent comment broke through my thoughts for the second time that morning. &ldquo;Hey Gary, you okay? You&rsquo;re not talking much&hellip;&rdquo; I turned to Petey after pulling my sweater-vest on, the ritual of dressing finally complete. He added, a bit jokingly, &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m complaining.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He fidgeted uncomfortably when my only reaction was to stare at him intently. Gathering information was probably the best course of action. &ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s today&rsquo;  s date?  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >He quirked an eyebrow suspiciously, but luckily he had enough brains to look at his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s, uh&hellip; the ninth. Of September?&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t seem satisfied. &ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re okay? You look kinda&hellip; worried..&rdquo; I nodded distractedly, busy drowning in my own thoughts. </p>
<p  >Holy shit </p>
<p  >HOLY SHIT </p>
<p  >Was I back at the beginning of the year somehow?   I&rsquo;ve always been a stickler for logic, and all the evidence pointed to fucking time travel?!? </p>
<p  >A grin spread slowly across my face. I was free! I could do it again! Do it <em>right</em> this time! </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p  >As soon as I felt the beginnings of consciousness, I clawed my way out of sleep until I was fully awake. Failure. <em>AGAIN.</em> I punched my pillow in frustration, desperately wishing it was the moron&rsquo;s face instead. I stopped, breathing heavily. The pillow was <em>mocking</em> me, I could fucking <em>see</em>   it.   &ldquo;SHUT <strong>UP</strong>  , MORON!  &rdquo; Blindly hurling the fluffy object across the room, I got out of bed and strode over to my wardrobe and started pulling clothing on at random. I didn&rsquo;t give a shit how I looked&mdash;I just wanted to shake Hopkins and get some ANSWERS. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s he fucking <em>doing</em> it!?&rdquo; I asked myself as I wrestled with my pants. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Uh.. doing what?&rdquo; I started, noticing Femme Boy&rsquo;s worried gaze for the first time. He was also clutching the pillow I&rsquo;d thrown. </p>
<p  >I frowned, then sighed. &ldquo;Nothing, Petey,&rdquo; No reason to make him suspicious so early on. I beamed at him reassuringly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just excited that the new kid is arriving today!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He bought it, nodding in agreement as he smiled sleepily. &ldquo;Oh, yeah, you wanna be friends with him, right?&rdquo; He finally got out of bed, walking over to his own wardrobe and stifling a yawn. &ldquo;I was thinking we could all be friends, you know? Sounds like nobody else&rdquo; I tuned out the rest, instead staring down at the floor as I sat down, pants around my ankles for the moment. What was I doing <em>wrong</em>  ? I  &rsquo;d tried this <em>twenty times</em> and it hadn&rsquo;t fucking worked <em>once</em>. I&rsquo;d gotten Jimmy to side with me this last time, but at the last second he had turned the tables on me and started working against me. I&rsquo;d even died six times! I shuddered as the sickening <strong><em>crunch</em></strong> from Hopkins&rsquo; body falling on my ribcage from this last try sounded through my head again. I hadn&rsquo;t died immediately, but I&rsquo;d struggled so much with the paramedic staff at the end that they&rsquo;d kept dropping me. &ldquo;&hellip;Hey, you alright? Need some help?&rdquo; I snapped out of my revere to see Peter Kowalski with a worried expression kneeling in front of me, his hand outstretched. I accepted the hand entirely automatically&mdash;for some reason my brain took the time to note that the light in our room was framing Petey in a halo. Pulling me to my feet, he gave me an odd look before asking, &ldquo;Are you <em>sure</em> you&rsquo;re all right? You seem really out of it,&rdquo; I finally snapped my gaze to his face, giving him my full attention. </p>
<p  >What was I even doing? I had a plan to make. Twenty-first time&rsquo;s the charm, right? &ldquo;Yeah. Yeah I&rsquo;  m fine,  &rdquo; Snatching my hand back from his, I turned around to leave the room, before promptly face-planting onto the floor because my pants were still down around my ankles. &ldquo;  Oof!  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >There was a pause before Petey started snickering. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re tooootally fine!&rdquo; I scrambled back up to my feet, yanking my undone pants back up. <u>That little fuck.</u> </p>
<p  >Glaring at him out the corner of my eye, I sneered, &ldquo;Like what you see, Femme Boy?&rdquo; That cut off his laughing. </p>
<p  >Instead, he grimaced, turning away to finish getting dressed, adding, &ldquo;Ew! Come on man, don&rsquo;t be gross,&rdquo; I just laughed. Man, laughing felt so good! </p>
<p  >As I finished buckling my belt and grabbing my keys, I called over my shoulder, &ldquo;Try not to think about me too much out there, Femme Boy&mdash;it might show~!&rdquo; I snickered at his whine through the paper-thin door. </p>
<p  >Turning to go downstairs, I switched gears and again considered my dilemma. I needed to figure out what the <em>fuck</em> Jimmy was doing to constantly outwit me.... But how could I do that? Glaring as a Bully shoved past me, I realized that what I really lack is information. I just don&rsquo;t know enough about Jimmy and how he responds to what I do&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not like I can just follow the moron around day in and day out, that&rsquo;d get boring real fast&hellip; right? </p>
<p  >Then again, maybe there <em>is</em> a way to follow him around&hellip; Surveillance equipment, perhaps? Seeing Jimmy round the corner, I prepared to give the whole newcomer spiel. Wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to give it a try&mdash;I&rsquo;d only need to do it a few times, anyway. Then I&rsquo;ll have all the information I need! I grinned as I commented that Jimmy was all pent up&mdash;he had better watch it this time; I was fucking on to him now! </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p  >The distant claps of thunder reminded me an awful lot of the tolling of bells. I automatically recited my lines&mdash;rather calmly, this time around. &ldquo;The thing is, if I win, you&rsquo;re just another punk....&rdquo; I sucked in a deep breath, taking a moment to admire the view&mdash;I don&rsquo;t usually come up here except for this&mdash;before shrugging as I continued, &ldquo;but if you win, you&rsquo;ll be sent away even faster for beating up the Head Boy,&rdquo; Granted, by this point Petey had probably figured out how to get Crabblesnitch on his side, but still. I wanted to make sure this loop was as close to the first as possible. </p>
<p  >And of course, the moron had his &lsquo;confused&rsquo; face&mdash;the one that looks like he&rsquo;s thinking  <em> whut wat duh? </em> &mdash;  on, and asked the pivotal question:   &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you do it, Gary!?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I  &rsquo;d been waiting <em>ages</em> for this! Clapping my hands in delight, I replied, &ldquo;  OH, I  &rsquo;m so happy you asked, Hopkins!&rdquo; I rubbed my hands together excitedly. &ldquo;  See, I  &rsquo;ve been trying to figure this out for..&rdquo; Pause for a few quick calculations. &ldquo;..about fifteen years now. And I finally did it!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy interrupted with an impatient growl. &ldquo;Just get to the fucking point already!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I held my hands up in a mock &lsquo;surrender&rsquo; gesture. &ldquo;All right, take a chill pill, why don&rsquo;t you, Jimmy-boy?&rdquo; I chuckled at my private joke as I paced back and forth on the construction scaffolding. &ldquo;You see Jimmy, the fact is that you&rsquo;re an idiot,&rdquo; I held up a hand, stopping his objections. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to deny it, it&rsquo;s true. But here&rsquo;s the more amazing thing&mdash;<em>I still lost</em>!&rdquo; I stopped pacing, letting that sink into the King Idiot&rsquo;s thick skull. His face gained even <em>more</em> &lsquo;  wut  &rsquo;. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;..you <em>lost?</em>&rdquo; Jimmy blinked. Clearly, this had been the last thing he&rsquo;d been expecting. &ldquo;&hellip;so what, are you giving up?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shrugged, stifling the urge to start cackling madly. &ldquo;In a way. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ll be around for the next few days anyway. Now, if I could continue?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy glanced around the empty rooftop, as if checking to see if anybody else was seeing this shit. &ldquo;Um, sure?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I grinned, resuming my pacing. &ldquo;You see, moron; the reason you were able to beat me so many times was, hilariously, as simple as you are! It was Petey!&rdquo; Understanding was finally starting to bloom in the moron&rsquo;s eyes. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What? What the fuck are you talk&ndash;  &rdquo;   I held up a hand again, interrupting him. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Now, now Jimmy! Credit where credit is due; Petey was the <em>only</em> reason you beat me, don&rsquo;t deny it. Hell, the little trooper&rsquo;s probably already gone to the police by now!&rdquo; Jimmy shifted uncomfortably&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t blame him, if I&rsquo;d had to rely on fucking <em>Femme Boy Kowalski</em> to do all my thinking for me, I&rsquo;d probably just curl up and die. Not that that would do me much good nowadays, but still. </p>
<p  >Jimmy frowned. &ldquo;Yeah, Petey helped me&hellip; but so what? That doesn&rsquo;t change anything!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >The dumbass had a point. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right, it <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> change anything&mdash;not for you, at least,&rdquo; I let my face split in a wide smile. &ldquo;But it changes <em>everything</em> for me!&rdquo; I shook my head, laughing at the sheer absurdity of it all. &ldquo;I mean, can you fucking <em>believe</em> it!? Fucking <em>Femme Boy</em>  !?!  &rdquo; I actually slapped a hand across my knee, practically guffawing at this point. Christ, I couldn&rsquo;t even remember the last time I&rsquo;d laughed this hard! </p>
<p  >And now, Jimmy was pissed again. &ldquo;Whad&rsquo;ya mean by that? What, is Pete not smart enough for your stupid fucking standards or something?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I managed to reign it in so it was just giggling. &ldquo;No, you see he <em>IS</em> smart! That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so fucking brilliant!&rdquo; I resumed my frantic pacing, gesticulating almost at random. &ldquo;Petey&rsquo;s literally the <em>only</em> person in this fucking town who actually has enough <em>brains</em> to mess with my plans, <em>and</em> he&rsquo;s the only person I&rsquo;d NEVER fucking suspect!&rdquo; I stopped again, shaking my head before pressing both my palms into my forehead. &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t get over it! I mean  &mdash;&rdquo;   I lifted my head to try and explain how ridiculous this situation is. &ldquo;I <em>live in his fucking room</em> and I NEVER considered he might betrey me! Not <strong><em>once</em></strong>!!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I would&rsquo;ve happily continued talking about this subject for quite a while, but Jimmy decided to interject at that point. &ldquo;So&hellip; you giving up or what?&rdquo; I stared at him for a few moments before sighing. </p>
<p  >This had been the plan all along anyway. &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Suddenly, I had an idea and added, &ldquo;Hey, can I talk to Petey before I get shipped off to Happy Volts? I&rsquo;d love to know how he did all this!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy blinked slowly. &ldquo;  Happy Volts?  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >God are you kidding me? I groaned my most patronizing, &ldquo;<em>Obviously</em> Happy Volts you moron!  &rdquo;   I started counting points off on my fingers as I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;I got people expelled, unfairly, put several others into therapy, turned the school into a <em>battleground</em> and, oh! Let&rsquo;s not mention all the property damage I caused,&rdquo; I snorted, crossing my arms and raising one eyebrow at Jimmy, daring him to object. &ldquo;I should <em>hope</em> I get put away after a stunt like that.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He frowned, shuffling his feet. I smirked; heh, this really wasn&rsquo;t going how he&rsquo;d thought it would. &ldquo;  Well, um  .. okay, sure you can talk to him&hellip;&rdquo; He suddenly glanced around at the scenery, as if only now noticing where we were.&nbsp; &ldquo;&hellip;why the fuck did you do all that &lsquo;chasing you through the school&rsquo; shit if that&rsquo;s all you wanted to say?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I threw my hands up as I began making my way over the scaffolding back the way we&rsquo;d come. &ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s what fucking <em>happens</em>, I don&rsquo;t know. I tried to keep this one as close to the original as possible, so I figured I should follow tradition.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Now Jimmy really was looking at me like I was bonkers. &ldquo;&hellip;wow you <em>are</em> fucking insane. The fuck does any of that even mean?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I just shot him a wink as I backed down a ladder, feeling the first droplets of rain on my skin. &ldquo;Now Jimmy, don&rsquo;t hurt yourself trying to understand it! Little Petey&rsquo;s going to need you to make sure he doesn&rsquo;t get beat up, after all,&rdquo; My mind was occupied with more important matters now, anyway: Petey Femme Boy Kowalski. I had a brand-new puzzle to work through! I barely noticed the police officers circling the base of the tower like sharks as I made my way down. Now that I know his importance, it&rsquo;ll be easy to get him to do my bidding&mdash;he&rsquo;s got practically no spine anyway! </p>
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 1: Just Another Day for your Average Time Traveler~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >After two agonizing hours of sitting around with only the moron for company, Petey finally rounded the corner of the alleyway I&rsquo;d parked on. Jimmy started trying to talk around his gag again, but he wasn&rsquo;t fast enough&mdash;the zip ties had already made short work of Petey&rsquo;s hands. He barely got in a, &ldquo;Whoa, wh&ndash;  &rdquo;   before I&rsquo;d thrown him in the backseat with Hopkins, hopped into the driver&rsquo;s seat, and peeled away. One minute and counting. </p>
<p  >Man, the <em>waiting</em> is my least favorite part of this step. I always feel like a cop will be the first person to round that corner. &ldquo;Phew.. sheesh Femme Boy, you sure took your sweet time, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The speedometer was inching past sixty now&mdash;I wanted to be doing a hundred after we got out of serious accident possibility range, but for now I needed the precision to turn down streets without totaling the vehicle. The cops would be on me in forty-five seconds, so I needed as big a head start as I could muster. </p>
<p  >There was a disorientated, &ldquo;Wha&ndash;holy shit, what?&rdquo; I could hear movement in the back before he stilled abruptly, noticing the gagged cries. &ldquo;&hellip;Jimmy? What..&rdquo; Then he stopped talking as he registered what I&rsquo;d said. &ldquo;..G-Gary?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I grunted. The innocent confusion is cute, but I really needed to concentrate in the next fifteen seconds so we didn&rsquo;t end up dead. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got questions, save them for when distracting me won&rsquo;t result in serious bodily trauma&mdash;okay, Pete?&rdquo; I took a deep breath. He&rsquo;d try and continue talking, but if my first evasive maneuver against these cops is a big one, he clams up big-time. </p>
<p  >Police sirens started wailing, and I saw Petey&rsquo;s head whip around at the sound. Seven seconds. &ldquo;...What the hell?&rdquo; He turned back around and pressed his face against the metal mesh that separated the backseat from the front seat. Two seconds. I tightened my grip in anticipation&mdash;this part is always fun. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s <em>happ</em>&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shouted, &ldquo;Hold onto your butts, kiddos!&rdquo; before turning the wheel sharply, causing the car to skid at an angle, just as two cop cars pulled up, sirens blaring. And would you look at that, my car was perfectly angled to speed through that gap; I floored it. &ldquo;Woooo, hahaha!&rdquo; Lucky for me, this car has pretty good horsepower. A few seconds of metal grinding against metal later, we made it through, sans the right-side rear-view mirror and a bit of paint. Still, all things considered that was one of my better attempts. I righted the steering wheel, and I could hear the contents of the backseat grunting and groaning as they hit the left side of the car as it straightened out and burned rubber out of town. I could take it easy for a few minutes now, thanks to some earlier tire sabotage. I flicked the siren on and headed off, shifting up to one-hundred. Mostly to myself I sighed a contented, &ldquo;Ah, there we go&mdash;damn, I gotta say, I <em>nailed</em> that,&rdquo; Turning to the back I added, &ldquo;Groan if you agree, Petey!&rdquo; In the back, he&rsquo;d somehow ended up on the floor of the vehicle, having lost his balance at some point in all the confusion. I heard a groan. &ldquo;Why thank you!~&rdquo; Heh, he&rsquo;s so cute. </p>
<p  >The next few minutes passed in silence as I focused on shifting the car delicately enough to avoid swerving off the road; going at such a high speed makes it very easy to careen out of control. Learned <em>that</em> the hard way. The outskirts of Bullworth whipped past, and soon we turned onto the side road I wanted&mdash;plus, far fewer cars to weave around. Eventually, we came to a stand-still, and I breathed a sigh of relief; that was the portion that had some of the highest probability for the cops catching me or of somebody being seriously injured or dying. </p>
<p  >I unbuckled myself and stepped out, opening the door behind the driver&rsquo;s seat to reveal a cowering Femme Boy. I sighed as I grabbed a handful of his uniform. Now we entered the scared-shitless stage of the proceedings. He gave an undignified squawk as I dragged him out and said, &ldquo;Come on Petey&mdash;we gotta get moving,&rdquo; I sighed as he started squirming, trying to escape my grip. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have <em>plenty</em> of time to be scared out of your mind, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; I had to press him against the side of the car to saw through the zip-tie binding his wrists. I have to make sure he doesn&rsquo;t free Jimmy, but I didn&rsquo;t have any reason to keep him locked up now. At the snap of plastic, Petey gazed at his hands as if he&rsquo;d never seen them before quickly turning around and backing away from me. </p>
<p  >I tried my best to smile reassuringly as I moved to the other side of the car. &ldquo;Better?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t answer as I opened Jimbo&rsquo;s door. I leaned against the door frame and maintained neutral eye contact. &ldquo;Now, moron&mdash;I know you have trouble understanding English, so let me explain this very simply,&rdquo; I leaned down to undo some of the duct-tape as I continued. &ldquo;The first time around you kicked me in the face, so I don&rsquo;t want a repeat this time,&rdquo; Meeting his gaze steadily, I smirked a bit and quoted something from back in the first loop. &ldquo;So; it&rsquo;s up to you! You gonna play nice or what?&rdquo; My smirk grew at the look of pure <em>rage</em> in his face, despite his grudging nod. I played along, saying, &ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; Of course, as I was undoing his seatbelt I saw him prepare to give me a headbutt. I pulled my head out of the way at the last second, grabbing the back of his shirt as he missed to yank him out of the car. Just for the heck of it, I gave him a swift kick to the balls. His cry of pain was stifled by the gag, but I made sure to relish it anyhow. </p>
<p  >As I moved around to the trunk, I laughed and sneered, &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s what I love about you, Jimmy; you&rsquo;ve always been so easy to control, even before I could predict your every action!&rdquo; I popped the trunk, taking a few moments to browse through the gym bag full of packs of hundred-dollar bills that the police had confiscated from some poor criminal. I didn&rsquo;t want to take the whole bag, since it was heavy and making Petey carry it was just adding humiliation to the conga line of trauma he&rsquo;d be going through in the next few days. So, I picked the ones that had the fewest fives and ones stashed inside and stuffed them into my jacket. I wasn&rsquo;t terribly worried, though; it could work. </p>
<p  >As I shifted my attention to the wire-filled box and timer I had added, I heard Petey&rsquo;s footsteps tentatively move over to where Jimmy&rsquo;d collapsed on the ground. &ldquo;Shit.... Jim&ndash;&rdquo; but the moron started making anxious sounds. From what had happened last time around, I deduced he was frantically signaling Petey to try and do something to me. I leaned forward, pretending to be absorbed in what I was doing&mdash;really, this was just for show; I&rsquo;d already set it to go off at the right time while waiting for him. </p>
<p  >I could sense him trying to creep up on me from a mile away. Part of that can probably be attributed to my all-consuming obsession, but it&rsquo;s also true that Petey isn&rsquo;t exactly Batman. As he lunged for me I stepped back, grabbing his wrist as he passed and swinging him around so we were pressed close together&mdash;me against the bumper of the car, him against me. I shivered at the contact as I brought my mouth close to his ear and whispered, &ldquo;Careful, now&mdash;it&rsquo;s rude to interrupt somebody while they&rsquo;re working on explosives.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I knew it was stupid to do this; I already had the timer set, and maneuvering a massive camper out of this place is no small feat, so I was just giving myself less room for error as I let the seconds tick down. But as I wrapped my arms around him to pull us closer together I couldn&rsquo;t care less. He let out a startled squeak that gave me the opportunity to reacquaint myself with the contours of the roof of his mouth and the shape of his teeth. The familiar warm tingling began to radiate out from where my mouth was latched onto his lips, and I let myself sink into his warmth, just a little; he was <em>here</em>! I wasn&rsquo;t going to be crushed under a car, vaporized by a bomb, or dragged off to Happy Volts before I even got to see him. I snaked my arm around his neck to draw him even closer as the exhilarating buzzing just beneath my skin wiped the fear away&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t alone anymore. </p>
<p  >A small, annoying portion of my brain piped up then, reminding me that we had to <em>go</em>. Of course&mdash;no rest for the wicked and all that. Reluctantly, I pulled away and took a shuddering breath, sighing as I tightened my arms around him. Burying my face in his hair, I muttered to myself, &ldquo;God I missed you so fucking much....&rdquo; Seven months with barely a fortnight&rsquo;s worth of interaction with him gets lonely. </p>
<p  >But it couldn&rsquo;t last. Even with my eyes closed, I could hear the confusion in his voice as he stammered, &ldquo;W-<em>wh-whaa</em>&ndash;!?..&rdquo; I braced a hand on his shoulder and pushed him back a little, raising the other hand to place a finger on his lips. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What&rsquo;d I say about asking questions, Petey?&rdquo; I turned around and hauled the containers of gasoline from the trunk as I continued. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m going to need your help getting our massive friend into the RV, m&rsquo;kay?&rdquo; As I backed away to where the camper was located, I made sure to assess his mental state. He was staring at me with a dazed mixture of fear and confusion&mdash;right on track, then. I nodded in Jimmy&rsquo;s direction, adding &ldquo;So go pick whether you wanna carry the feet or the head,&rdquo; He nodded automatically; that was good&mdash;if he has something to do, he doesn&rsquo;t fight as much. I let out a breath as I turned around, feeling the lingering tingle on my skin when I set the cans down to fish out the keys. God, even after centuries he <em>still</em> lingers like no one else. Shaking my head, I consulted my mental list as I set the containers by the doorway. Hm.. the gas tank should be full, Petey and Jimmy already ate dinner at school, and the bomb was set to go off in fifteen minutes. I allowed myself a small smile as I made my way to the front of the vehicle and plopped down in front of the wheel; everything was on-schedule. </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p  >What&rsquo;s interesting about constantly saying shocking things to people is that they don&rsquo;t gasp or recoil right away. Usually they don&rsquo;t even register what you&rsquo;re saying as shocking&mdash;they just blink. Then, they snap into whatever reaction you were originally expecting, depending on the person. For Hopkins, it would probably be anger. Petey tends to go for a more &lsquo;  stricken  &rsquo; look. Right now, though, he was giving Jimmy&rsquo;s patented wat-whut-duh a run for its money. &ldquo;You want to <em>blow</em>   me?  &rdquo; He leaned back, the customary disgust written all over his face. Then the confusion returned. &ldquo;What, like&hellip;&rdquo; he pointed at his crotch, &ldquo;&hellip;<strong>blow</strong>, blow? Blow<em>job</em>  ?  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snickered&mdash;I love this part. It&rsquo;s the only moment where the fear really disappears. &ldquo;Yeah, Petey. Since I wasn&rsquo;t clear enough, I meant oral sex,&rdquo; I held eye contact for a few moments after that, before shifting my gaze over to Jimmy-boy, who was currently under lock-and-key, duct-taped to the chair by the door of the trailer. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really <strong>asking</strong>,&rdquo; I sighed, looking out the window as I recalled the hundreds of tries it&rsquo;d taken before I realized there wasn&rsquo;t a way to get Petey to do what I want without forcing him. <em>Again.</em> Why&rsquo;s he so Goddamn  <em> stubborn </em> ? Jesus  .... </p>
<p  >I couldn&rsquo;t see him, but I knew he was frowning. &ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re not asking&rsquo;  ?  &rdquo; Instead of responding, I slipped out of my seat and flipped my knife out of its holder, tossing it from hand to hand as I held Jimmy&rsquo;s gaze. I smirked as his eyes widened to the size of saucers and his struggling took on a decidedly more desperate tone. Being able to torture Jimmy has been one of the perks of this whole endeavor. </p>
<p  >I turned back to Petey, who&rsquo;d taken on his favored &lsquo;  stricken  &rsquo; look, shrugging. &ldquo;What do you <em>think</em> I dragged the moron all the way out here for?&rdquo; I crossed my arms and leaned against the cabinets casually, pulling the key for his handcuffs out of my shirt and swinging them as I glanced at him in condescension. &ldquo;Certainly not for the intelligent conversation.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Now Petey&rsquo;s face was positively horrified. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you gonna do, <em>torture</em> him!?&rdquo; Sigh; he really can be slow sometimes. </p>
<p  >I nodded, saying, &ldquo;Yes, Petey. That is exactly what I&rsquo;ll do, <em>IF</em> you don&rsquo;t do what I want,&rdquo; The two of them exchanged a scared-shitless look. Petey opened his mouth again after a moment, but I already knew what he was going to say. &ldquo;And before you ask, the reason I&rsquo;m not threatening to torture <em>you</em> is because it doesn&rsquo;t work. Believe me; I&rsquo;ve tried,&rdquo; I tried to ignore the memories that swam up at that; boy had <strong>that</strong> backfired. </p>
<p  >I let everybody sit in silence for a few seconds after that to process. Finally, Petey said, &ldquo;You.. said that if I had any questions I could ask you later? Is now good?&rdquo; I nodded, indicating he should continue. The sex stuff could wait, after all. &ldquo;Well, I guess my first question is&hellip; why are you doing this?&rdquo; I smiled, turning around to root around in the cabinets for something to eat. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Ah, our little Petey-weety, always going straight for the jugular,&rdquo; I found some chips, munching as I sat back down. &ldquo;Well, the answer is simple: because I can,&rdquo; Placing the can on the table, I leaned back and saw Hopkins glaring at me out of the corner of my eye. I elected to ignore him. &ldquo;Next question?&rdquo; He frowned, and was about to object and tell me there had to be more to it than that (he was right, of course), but I leaned forward and slammed the knife into the table and said again, &ldquo;  Next. Question.  &rdquo; I don&rsquo;t get into my emotional hang-ups at the best of times, and now was certainly no exception, especially when he would only know for a month. </p>
<p  >Petey seemed about ready to piss his pants at that. &ldquo;UH I-I&rsquo;  m sorry!  &rdquo; I leaned back casually, nodding for him to continue. He needed a moment to catch his breath, though&mdash;and another to think of another question. &ldquo;Uh.. how, um.. how lo-long are you going to keep us here?&rdquo; Ah, an easy one. </p>
<p  >I shrugged, lifting one arm in an &lsquo;I dunno&rsquo; stance and using the other to open the can and shake out a chip. &ldquo;Depends&mdash;you&rsquo;ll probably escape at some point, but there&rsquo;s only a month left in the loop, so&hellip;&rdquo; I held one out to him as I talked, but he shook his head meekly in refusal. &ldquo;&hellip;worst-case scenario for you two is a month,&rdquo; Crunching the chip, I leaned back, giving a &lsquo;what can ya do&rsquo;   shrug.   &ldquo;All in all, probably not the worst month of your lives, especially considering the seven months you just spent at Bullworth,&rdquo; A lie? Yes, but one I wished were true. For Petey, anyway. </p>
<p  >He blinked, furrowing his brow in confusion. &ldquo;Wait&hellip; you&rsquo;ll let us go after a month?&rdquo; I could see the hope burning in his eyes&mdash;time to put that nonsense to bed. </p>
<p  >I tskd, wagging my finger at him. &ldquo;Now, now Femme Boy!&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t say <em>that</em>. I said that the loop would be ending in a month. If I can, I&rsquo;ll, of course, be sticking around longer,&rdquo; That clearly got neurons firing in his brain. I smirked&mdash;a quick glance at the moron confirmed my suspicion that his face was full of nothing but whut-wat-duh. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;the loop&rsquo;ll be ending&rsquo;? What&rsquo;s a &lsquo;  loop  &rsquo;  ?  &rdquo; I grinned. I imagine that, were it someone else in my place, they might get tired of having to explain it over and over&mdash;for me, though, it&rsquo;s one of my favorite parts. </p>
<p  >I clapped my hands eagerly. &ldquo;Ah, finally, we get to the <em>important</em>   questions!  &rdquo; I yanked the knife out of the table, twirling it absentmindedly. It felt better than drumming my fingers on the table, at least. &ldquo;A &lsquo;  loop  &rsquo; is a period of time that one repeats, retaining their memories while the world, their body, and everybody else&rsquo;s memories revert to however they were at the point that the loop began.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey looked weirded out by the knife, but he&rsquo;d clearly understood what I&rsquo;d said as his eyebrows scrunched up in his &lsquo;processing&rsquo; face. Eventually, he said, &ldquo;&hellip;what, like&hellip;&rdquo; he snapped his fingers, trying to remember &ldquo;uh, that movie with the guy from Ghostbusters? Who kept re-living the same day? What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; he glanced between me and Jimmy, who shot him a dumbstruck look, and not even in the sense that he was dumb and had been hit in the head. Petey wilted a bit. &ldquo;Um.. I mean&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snickered. &ldquo;Bill Murry?&rdquo; He nodded nervously; seemed he&rsquo;d remembered the situation he was in. &ldquo;And here I thought you were too cool to be a dork, Petey.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Quietly as I paused playing with the knife to grab another chip, he added &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m apparently too dorkey to be anything else.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >His inferiority complex has, like most things Kowalski, only become more baffling as the years pass. And like so many things Petey related, I had no idea how to address it. &ldquo;That would be the film <em>Groundhog Day</em>; and yeah, my situation is pretty similar. Except it&rsquo;s eight months instead of one day.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy was rolling his eyes so hard I was surprised they didn&rsquo;t fall out of his skull, but Petey was staring at me with a combination of incredulity, fear, and (to my disgust) pity. The three emotions warred for supremacy before he settled on incredulity. &ldquo;Wait, wait.. so.. you&rsquo;ve telling me you&rsquo;ve been re-living the same eight months for..&rdquo; Here he frowned. &ldquo;..Um&hellip; how long?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >An interesting question. I shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Petey. I lost count around the five-hundred mark,&rdquo; I narrowed my eyes as the pity made a short reappearance, but luckily it was gone quickly. </p>
<p  >He laid his hands flat on the table before raising them to help him gesture while he talked. &ldquo;Okay so.. you&rsquo;ve been alive for, uh, a <em>super</em> long time&hellip; and you&rsquo;re using that knowledge to <strong><em>blackmail</em></strong><em> me into having <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">sex  with you</em>  !?  &rdquo; The poor boy looked so confused. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Aw, come on Femme Boy, don&rsquo;t sell yourself so short!&rdquo; I gestured in his general direction with the knife, adding, &ldquo;Who <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> want to blackmail you into having sex with them?&rdquo; I snickered at his utter bafflement. <em>Man</em>, I&rsquo;d missed this for the past seven months. That&rsquo;s the real downside to this whole thing&mdash;the prep time. Oh well, Petey was certainly making up for lost time, even if I had lived this conversation a couple of times already. </p>
<p  >He slapped his forehead with an open palm, muttering through clenched teeth, &ldquo;I was emphasizing the <em>blackmail</em> part....&rdquo; He stayed that way for a bit, taking a deep breath. The last couple of times I&rsquo;d been stupid and let him keep talking&mdash;and he&rsquo;d asked why I couldn&rsquo;t have just asked him to have sex like a normal person, and then I&rsquo;d had to ignore the memories of dating him for years only to be told over and over that he just &lsquo;wasn&rsquo;t ready for that&rsquo;. </p>
<p  >This time I didn&rsquo;t let him ask. &ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s rather late. How about getting some sleep?&rdquo; I returned my knife to its holder and got up from my seat to kneel by the cabinets next to the &lsquo;kitchen&rsquo; sink. </p>
<p  >I rooted around in the bags I&rsquo;d stashed there as he responded. &ldquo;What?  <em> Sleep </em> ? But I&rsquo;ve still got a bunch of ques  &mdash;&rdquo;   I threw a tank-top at his face, interrupting him. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;I am, in fact, aware of the fact that you&rsquo;ve got more questions!&rdquo; I grabbed some toothbrushes and a tube of toothpaste before straightening up and turning toward him as he brought the shirt away to scan it questioningly. &ldquo;The fact that I interrupted you means I&rsquo;m not going to answer them,&rdquo; I held out a toothbrush to him. &ldquo;Anyway, here you go,&rdquo; I smirked when he took it, adding a, &ldquo;Ladies first!&rdquo; as I gestured to the sink. </p>
<p  >He scowled, but walked up to the sink when I moved away anyway. As he squeezed toothpaste onto the new toothbrush, he said hesitantly, &ldquo;Um, can I at least ask why you just threw a shirt at me?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I chuckled, shrugging. &ldquo;I guess so&mdash;you&rsquo;ve only got the one shirt to last you a whole month, so best to at least try and keep it clean, hm?&rdquo;   We  &rsquo;d have to stock up on more varieties of clothing while on the road. </p>
<p  >Petey tilted his head, shrugging, as if to say &lsquo;makes sense&rsquo;, but with the toothbrush in his mouth I doubt I would&rsquo;ve heard him very clearly. He turned and spat into the sink before adding, &ldquo;What about Jimmy?&rdquo; I felt my eye twitch at mention of the moron. </p>
<p  >I couldn&rsquo;t get too mad about it, though. &ldquo;What <em>about</em> Jimmy?&rdquo; Petey looked a bit worried&mdash;seemed he&rsquo;d noticed my twitch. </p>
<p  >His eyes flickered over to the moron&rsquo;s corner as he asked cautiously, &ldquo;Ummm.. you got him a shirt too, right?&rdquo; I closed my eyes so I couldn&rsquo;t see the moron. I assume he looked angry. When I opened them Petey had turned around and his eyebrows had shot up&mdash;seemed he&rsquo;d had an idea. &ldquo;Hey, shouldn&rsquo;t he get a toothbrush too?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I narrowed my eyes. &ldquo;  No.  &rdquo; My tone invited no argument. </p>
<p  >I reached for the toothpaste myself as I could hear Petey swallow. &ldquo;Oh. Uh, okay then..&rdquo; There was relative quiet as the sound of my brushing, Jimmy&rsquo;s occasional struggles, and the wind outside were the only sounds for a few moments. Then, Petey added, &ldquo;So where am I sleeping?&rdquo; I rolled my eyes as I finished, spitting out most of the toothpaste before giving him a very pointed look over my shoulder. Didn&rsquo;t hurt that there was still some <em>white</em> toothpaste leaking out the corner of my mouth. I smirked when Petey stiffened as I turned back to rinse my mouth out. &ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;m sleeping with you, then?&rdquo; That made me snort with laughter, which resulted in a less than graceful spit into the sink. </p>
<p  >I straightened up, wiping the excess water and paste off with the back of my hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure that&rsquo;s what I said at the beginning of all this, Femme Boy!&rdquo; I snickered as he processed my meaning before I grabbed his hand and started pulling him toward the bedroom. I felt my heart-rate pick up <em>just</em> at the skin-to-skin contact. God, I&rsquo;m fucking pathetic. I brushed my thumb over his scar as I continued. &ldquo;I suppose you could sleep on the seats for the table, but they&rsquo;re really not very comfortable. Plus,&rdquo; After snapping the lights for the main room out, I turned and made eye-contact. He was a little weirded out, but at least he was still listening. &ldquo;If you want to increase the odds that I&rsquo;ll fall asleep, which I imagine you will, you&rsquo;re going to want to be in the bed with me. Trust me,&rdquo; It&rsquo;s true&mdash;falling asleep is easier for me when there&rsquo;s somebody else with me. Well, somebody I don&rsquo;t hate. And doesn&rsquo;t smell like shit. And doesn&rsquo;t snore.  </p>
<p  >Petey nodded as I pulled him into the bedroom, before he started and turned around, saying, &ldquo;  Oh, um  &mdash;good n&ndash;  &rdquo;   before I cut him off by shutting the door. I closed my eyes, letting out a huff. I guess it was too much to hope he wouldn&rsquo;t try and say something to the moron this time. &ldquo;&ndash;ight.. uhh.. sorry?&rdquo; I turned away and dropped his wrist before opening my eyes again. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;It is what it is.&rdquo; I sat down on one side of the bed and started changing into my sleepwear, keeping my body angled away from him. I &shy;&shy;&shy;knew for a fact that he would <em>not</em> respond well to having me stare at him while he changed. When I was done, I just listened to the sounds of him dressing (and undressing), trying to quiet the butterflies in my stomach. I had only done this part a few times, and I knew I&rsquo;d have to go through a bunch of iterations before I was able to know exactly what to do, but I have a rough idea of what needs to happen. Petey needs to know that I <em>want</em> him, and that he doesn&rsquo;t have a say in the matter. That means doing something <em>very</em> blatantly sexual the first night. This time around I grabbed a book from the floor that I&rsquo;d stashed in here earlier and kicked out on the bed, careful to not take up too much space on the bed. I heard him hesitate as I cracked the book open&mdash;that wouldn&rsquo;t do. &ldquo;You go ahead&mdash;I&rsquo;m gonna stay up for a bit,&rdquo; He looked confused&mdash;that <em>did</em> contradict what I&rsquo;d said before we&rsquo;d entered the room&mdash;before shrugging and getting into the bed. Luckily, my experiment paid off; I made sure to actually read, too, so that the page-turns weren&rsquo;t off, timing wise. Soon, he was out like a light. </p>
<p  >I smiled, feeling a coil of heat join the butterflies in my gut. Petey is a <em>real</em> heavy sleeper, so I can do a variety of things without him even waking up. I set the book aside and slowly peeled the covers back, really wishing I could keep the lights on for this part, but oh well. I&rsquo;d have to make do with the booklight. Even though I knew he&rsquo;d put the shirt I&rsquo;d given him on&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t refused before and I had no reason to suspect that he wouldn&rsquo;t put it on&mdash;I still felt the coil of heat tighten a bit when I saw he was wearing it. </p>
<p  >Now, I don&rsquo;t normally watch Petey sleep&mdash;I mean, I&rsquo;ve done it in the past, but it&rsquo;s damn boring. Because, let&rsquo;s be honest, sleeping is only one step above a comma. But since I had to wait for him to start dreaming and get a stiffy, I now had to spend the next hour or so with a sleeping Femme Boy. I snuggled up next to him, pulling him into my arms and burying my face in his curly hair. His breathing hardly even changed&mdash;seemed he hadn&rsquo;t cut it this time around. The impulse to just fall asleep with him in my arms was strong. But, that would mean messing up the plan. And I couldn&rsquo;t do that. </p>
<p  >Still, just feeling him there was so good; I had to turn him onto his back to stick to the plan. Pulling his shirt up, I started running my hands over his chest. I moistened my lips as I switched between roving my eyes over the familiar sight of his body and making sure that he was still asleep. My first time with this plan he&rsquo;d woken up in the middle of it and hadn&rsquo;t been able to fall asleep the rest of the night, which had forced me to reset early. Annoying. </p>
<p  >I had already known about the mole on his belly before this project, but now I could see there was a tiny, second patch of brown skin just beneath the larger mole. Right next to the line of faint hair that&mdash;I swallowed&mdash;led a trail right into his underwear. After some time, my eyes were drawn ever further down&mdash;seemed <em>some</em>body was having a good time in dreamland. </p>
<p  >I took a deep breath. Okay. Now was the time. I adjusted the position of Petey&rsquo;s legs a little to give myself easier access before unbuttoning his boxers so that his cock stood exposed. I started by slowly stroking him, which I  <em> still </em>  can&rsquo;t believe doesn&rsquo;t wake him up. He may have shifted into my hand a little, but it was impossible to tell if it was in response to what I was doing. &lt;&gt; No doubt about it now&mdash;I was pretty sure that was as hard as he was going to get. Time for the main event. </p>
<p  >Leaning down, I ran my tongue along his length&mdash;turns out not even Petey can sleep through that. He did this adorable little bucking motion with his hips before waking up, too. &ldquo;Uhh&hellip; wha  &mdash;&rdquo;   His voice was so thick with sleep; in the previous loop he&rsquo;d noticed me at this point, but this time around I started sucking on the tip, and he clearly stopped giving a shit exactly <em>who</em> was doing this to him. &ldquo;  aahh~  &rdquo; Had I been able to, I would have smirked as I began running one hand along the inside of his thigh. </p>
<p  >I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of sex over the centuries; I&rsquo;m only attracted to people that remind me of Petey, but I&rsquo;ve needed to have sex with people to further projects or manipulate them or some such, so I have rather a lot of experience with the act. Not to mention personal experience with Femme Boy himself, as much as I hate to admit it. As such, I&rsquo;ve been struck by how quiet he is at this step. I was going to town, and most guys would be groaning my name and thrusting helplessly by now, but the most he was giving me was a small whimper. I glanced up, and we locked eyes. Funny how, even after all this time, seeing the fear and confusion in his face still hurts. I watched him as I pressed my tongue against the bit of skin where the head of his penis met the shaft&mdash;he kept his hands to himself, balling up the sheets instead of grabbing my head like a normal person. I didn&rsquo;t like that. Hm&hellip; I&rsquo;d been able to get him to come just by doing what I was doing now the last couple of times, but maybe if I changed tactics, I could get a bigger reaction? I stopped my stroking and sucking altogether, switching to longer, slower licks. Petey, to my annoyance, didn&rsquo;t give any sign of feeling <em>any</em>thing. A quick scan of his face revealed the fact that he had his whole arm pressed against his eyes, hiding most of his expression&mdash;but I could see his jaw just fine, and he was clearly clenching it <em>very</em> tightly. So this was affecting him! Good. I gently traced one of the veins on his cock with the tip of my tongue before taking a deep breath and abruptly swallowing as much of him as I could. Let&rsquo;s see him ignore <em>that</em>! I was rewarded for my efforts with a strong buck of the hips and a startled gasp that he cut short by slapping his hand over his mouth. Typical Petey to refuse to just let go and give in to a sensation. I only got a stifled, &ldquo;  mmm!  &hellip;&rdquo; as a warning before getting a mouth full of cum. Ugh. I&rsquo;ve never been fond of how semen tastes&mdash;I always avoid it when I blow anybody&mdash;but it was Petey, so I could roll with it. I swallowed most of it and wiped the left-overs off on the back of my hand before crawling back to lie down next to him. </p>
<p  >Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong&mdash;I&rsquo;m hardly so deluded that I believe that I&rsquo;ll be able to <em>make</em> Petey like me by doing this to him&mdash;already tried it, failed spectacularly. But honestly? As long as I can pretend that he does, I don&rsquo;t fucking care anymore. </p>

<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 2: Escape Paralysis~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I wanted to recoil away as Gary curled up against me and started <em>cuddling</em> me, but I couldn&rsquo;t. As I was staring up at the ceiling, I had the weirdest feeling of being trapped in my body but separate from it at the same time. </p>
<p  >Guess he hadn&rsquo;t been messing around about the blowjob thing.  </p>
<p  >Eventually, though, the weird paralysis faded and the rhythmic heat at my side was at a lower tempo, letting me pry his arms off my waist and replace it with a pillow. After shutting the door, I let out a breath I didn&rsquo;t realize I&rsquo;d been holding in. </p>
<p  >Then I paused. Now what? I&rsquo;d never thought about how I would react to being&hellip; ra.. rap&hellip; er, to a guy randomly blowing me, but I&rsquo;d have figured it would involve crying or screaming or something. But I didn&rsquo;t really want to do either of those things&mdash;I just felt kind of&hellip; numb. </p>
<p  >Well actually, I had to pee. Was that because of the.. I shook my head as I felt my way toward the bathroom&mdash;no point asking stupid questions. I finally found the switch and flicked it on, flinching at the sudden flood of light. I heard a groan behind me, then a bunch of muffled cries. Shit, I&rsquo;d forgot! I turned around and immediately started whispering, trying to get him to shut up. &ldquo;Jimmy, quiet&mdash;you might wake Gary!&rdquo; That clammed him up fast&mdash;his eyes flicked fearfully toward the bedroom door. &hellip;Or maybe he was angry. I couldn&rsquo;t really tell; he&rsquo;s pretty hard to read. </p>
<p  >After waiting for a minute or so, I crept over to him and knelt down. &ldquo;&hellip;Alright, I&rsquo;m going to take off the duct tape now, and it&rsquo;s probably going to hurt&mdash;but you can&rsquo;t yell, okay?&rdquo; He nodded, and I grabbed one end of the duct-tape gag. I let him squeeze his eyes shut and take a deep breath before counting &ldquo;One, two, <em>three</em>.&rdquo;   RRRRRRRIP. </p>
<p  >&ldquo; <sub> Jesus fuck! </sub> &rdquo; I was impressed&mdash;I doubted I&rsquo;d be able to hold back a yell at something like that. He blew out a breath before scanning my face. &ldquo;Dude, are you okay? What&rsquo;d he do?&rdquo; That question suddenly made me hyperaware of the moist parts of my boxers I could feel pressing against me. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Um, no. I mean he didn&rsquo;t. I-I mean he didn&rsquo;t..&rdquo; My voice as shaking way too much to be convincing. &ldquo;..I didn&rsquo;t get, uh, hurt or a-anything..&rdquo; My stomach clenched painfully&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t buy it. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fucking <em>deaf</em>, Pete,&rdquo; I looked away as the embarrassment made my whole face hot. &ldquo;Aw, fuck.. Pete, I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;come on, look at me, man,&rdquo; I took a breath before facing him again. It was hard to see in the dark, though. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. Okay?&rdquo; I swallowed as we maintained eye-contact. He sounded so <em>sure</em> about it.. </p>
<p  >I nodded slowly. &ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, I know,&rdquo; and I did know it was true logically, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; I absently started picking at the duct tape on my hand. &ldquo;&hellip;it&rsquo;s a lot to take in. I guess.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Pun intended?&rdquo; I paused in trying to get the tape off of my fingers, shooting him a puzzled glance. </p>
<p  >Then I got it and groaned. &ldquo;Oh my God, Jimmy, that&rsquo;s disgusting!&rdquo;  </p>
<p  >He looked very proud of himself as usual anyway. &ldquo;Haha, <em>come</em> on Pete, I&rsquo;m just tryin&rsquo; to lighten the <em>load</em> a little!&rdquo; And that was so dumb that I couldn&rsquo;t help but snicker at it. But at least for that one moment, we could&rsquo;ve just been hanging out during lunch or at the docks like any regular day. A sudden blast of wind popped the brief bubble of normalcy, and we both froze, eyes on the bedroom door. </p>
<p  >Jimmy snapped out of it first to growl profanities under his breath. &ldquo;  Shit, we   gotta get out. Hey,&rdquo; He nudged his knee against me pointedly. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ya think you could get the key to these things?&rdquo; He jangled the handcuffs as my heart sank. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;He&rsquo;s.. still got them on that necklace,&rdquo; I pointedly didn&rsquo;t look at the door, but I still felt it loom behind me. &ldquo;I.. I don&rsquo;t think I could get them off without waking him up....&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy swore again. Then he sighed. &ldquo;  Welp, I  &rsquo;  m outta ideas,  &rdquo; He shot me a quizzical look. &ldquo;How &lsquo;bout you?&rdquo; I was about to shake my head&mdash;but I stopped. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;..Actually.. maybe?&rdquo; I got to my feet as I considered the inkling of an idea. Everything else in my mind felt so empty that anything new was a welcome distraciton. &ldquo;Just.. hold on, I gotta go to the bathroom,&rdquo; He nodded, and I shut the door behind me. I concentrated&mdash;what had that thought been.. the chair. Right, Jimmy&rsquo;s chair. I switched to autopilot and started undoing my boxers, but stopped when I felt even more clammy patches rub against my dick. The memory of drowning in a tidal wave of sensation hit like a brick, forcing me to brace my arm against the wall as my body pulsed with nausea. </p>
<p  >I&rsquo;m <em>helpless</em>. Trying to fight him hadn&rsquo;t even occurred to me! I could still feel the flat of his tongue slime over the tip&mdash;a bit of bile rose to the back of my throat. Nothing came out, though. </p>
<p  >I was trapped. Trapped in a fucking metal box with my best friend at the mercy of somebody I&rsquo;d known since I was a little kid. Somebody who thinks he&rsquo;s a time traveler. Somebody I&rsquo;d seen toss a knife around like a plaything. Somebody who was willing to do anything to get what he wanted. </p>
<p  >How could we possibly beat that? </p>
<p  >A sudden whisper managed to cut through the haze of hopelessness and anger that was swirling around my head. &ldquo;Pete! Pete, you okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I pressed my hand to my racing heart as I whispered back &ldquo;Yeah, sorry, just..&rdquo; I took a shuddering breath to steady myself and grabbed some toilet paper, rubbing as much of the spit off as I could. I had to focus on what was important&mdash;and right now, that was Jimmy. My hands were trembling too much to undo my boxers, so I just pulled them off and sat down before going. Okay, okay.. Jimmy&rsquo;s chair. So. Jimmy&rsquo;s a pretty strong guy&mdash;if I undid the rest of the tape, maybe we could Jimmy&rsquo;s chair outside? Finally done, I yanked my boxers back on as fast as I could before taking a deep breath and exiting into the main &lsquo;room&rsquo;. I stage-whispered to remind myself I wasn&rsquo;t the only person here. &ldquo;What if we just&hellip; left?&rdquo; Jimmy looked skeptical, but nodded for me to continue. &ldquo;I mean just take the chair with us and find a way to destroy it as soon as we can?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy shook his head. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t&mdash;fuckin&rsquo; thing&rsquo;s attached to the wall.&rdquo;  </p>
<p  >My shoulders slumped. &ldquo;Crap&hellip; then I&rsquo;m out of ideas,&rdquo; Jimmy&rsquo;s eyes suddenly widened a bit. &ldquo;What? You got one?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy nodded enthusiastically. &ldquo;Yeah, why don&rsquo;t <em>you</em> just leave?&rdquo; He nodded at the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like its locked or anything. Then you can go get help!&rdquo; I frowned, looking at the door. I flashed on the terrifying paralysis from the overstimulation I&rsquo;d felt when we locked eyes and he&rsquo;d just kept&ndash;I shook my head to dispel the images, instead focusing on Jimmy and the door, biting my lip. </p>
<p  >I shook my head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how far I need to go, or even where&mdash;and..&rdquo; I gulped, feeling the fear twist my gut as I saw Gary twirling that knife, and how  <em> gleeful </em>  he&rsquo;d looked. &ldquo;..if it takes too long, I don&rsquo;t know what Gary might do to you,&rdquo; Jimmy looked like he was going to protest, but I squatted down to his eye level and, grabbing his shoulders to emphasize my point, tried to pour every ounce of imploring into my body language that I could. &ldquo;Jimmy, you heard him&mdash;he <em>needs</em> you to get to me!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy wined a bit, interrupting me. &ldquo;Yeah, no duh! That&rsquo;s why you gotta get the fuck outta here, dude!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I suppressed an annoyed groan; he wasn&rsquo;t getting the full picture.   &ldquo;Jimmy, if <em>I&rsquo;m</em> not here, he won&rsquo;t have a reason to keep you.. you know. Alive.&rdquo;  </p>
<p  >The wind whistled outside. &ldquo;&hellip;fuuuuck I didn&rsquo;t think of that!&rdquo; He threw his head back, banging it against the back of the chair in what appeared to be an approximation of a facepalm. &ldquo;balls,&rdquo; We sat in silence for a couple minutes, listening to the nighttime sounds of the lower New York state countryside. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it some more, &lsquo;kay dude?&rdquo; I nodded distractedly. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;Mom and Dad used to take me camping out here, sometimes.&rdquo; Jimmy lifted his head back up to look at me. &ldquo;&hellip;we&rsquo;d all sit around a campfire and Dad would read a story out loud as Mom and I r-roasted marshmallows&hellip;&rdquo; I started blinking furiously&mdash;oh sure, <em>NOW</em> I start crying! </p>
<p  >Jimmy snorted. &ldquo;Sounds nice,&rdquo; He gave an ironic half-smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even sure some of my step-dads <em>could</em> read,&rdquo; I forced a relieved laugh&mdash;he was making me feel almost <em>normal</em>. I leaned forward to give him a hug. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Thanks, Jimmy. I&rsquo;m.. well&hellip;&rdquo; I laughed a bit as I pulled away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not glad you&rsquo;re <em>here</em>, but&hellip; I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re with me.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy looked surprised for a bit, but he smiled, leaning forward to press his forehead against mine. &ldquo;Yeah, me too.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >~~~ </p>
<p  >&lsquo;Course after that, I had to get Jimmy a pillow or extra blanket or something&mdash;he deserved to at least be comfortable, right? I entered the bedroom as quietly as I could, relieved to find Gary still asleep. Then, I noticed a problem. Gary had his head on one of the pillows.. and the one I&rsquo;d given him was still in his arms. </p>
<p  >Shit. </p>
<p  >I debated mentally for a bit before deciding to try and get the one he was holding. Probably moving his head would be more disturbing, right? So I tentatively moved closer to pry his fingers off the pillow. To my annoyance, he was gripping it really tightly. Without thinking I tugged a little harder&mdash;<em>shit</em>! I glanced at his face and the one eye that was facing upward had popped open. I was kinda surprised the pupil didn&rsquo;t shrink into a slit, like a cat. Or a snake. </p>
<p  >The impromptu staring contest lasted for a few moments until Gary broke eye-contact, his gaze flicking down to the pillow in his arms. He frowned. &ldquo;Oh, right,&rdquo; He immediately let go, pushing himself into a sitting position with one hand and rubbing his eyes with the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;  d forgotten  &mdash;you did that last time, too.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&nbsp;I let out an unconscious apology &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; that seemed to flip a switch, and his head snapped from staring blankly at the wall to leaning toward me affectionately and grinning. </p>
<p  >I leaned away a little, hoping he wouldn&rsquo;t notice. &ldquo;Oh, Femme Boy&mdash;you&rsquo;re always full of surprises, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t answer. Whatever had cheered Gary up about the apology dimmed very quickly, and he went back to staring blankly at nothing in particular. </p>
<p  >I started backing out of the room, but quickly realized leaving may not be the best choice&mdash;he might get mad or something. &ldquo;Um.. hey, can I&ndash;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T&ndash;&rdquo; He&rsquo;d suddenly started grabbing his hair, cutting himself off after the sudden shout. I took a few more steps back. What the hell was <em>that</em> about? He kept his face hidden in his arms when he hissed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <em>care</em>, Femme Boy.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;I just, can I take this pillow out to Ji&ndash;&rdquo; Another pillow hit me in the face. </p>
<p  >He was still hissing through his teeth, but he&rsquo;d turned the volume down. &ldquo;I just fucking said I don&rsquo;t <em>care</em>,&rdquo; By the time I was able to pick the pillow up, Gary had curled up on his side on the bed, facing so his expression was hidden from view. </p>
<p  >Guess that meant I was allowed. I tried to make it look like I wasn&rsquo;t bolting for the door, and found Jimmy staring at me fearfully. He whispered as I got close to put the pillow behind his head. &ldquo;What the fuck was <em>that</em>?&rdquo; I shrugged, adjusting the pillow before turning back to the door. I felt a fresh wave of nausea crash over me as I straightened up and felt my dick rub against my underwear. I flinched a little, but when Jimmy hissed, &ldquo;Pete? You oka&ndash;&rdquo; I found myself able to shoot him a pretty genuine &lsquo;I&rsquo;m okay, don&rsquo;t worry&rsquo; expression. So long as he was okay, I&rsquo;d be alright. </p>
<p  >Gary was still curled up on his side, but a question popped into my head suddenly, and I asked without fully considering it. &ldquo;How many times have you killed us?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t see his reaction, but after a moment he lifted his head before twisting himself into a sitting position to fix me with a grin that made me really nervous. I tried to ignore his body heat, but it was hard to avoid touching him since the bed wasn&rsquo;t exactly huge. Surprise, surprise. </p>
<p  >He crossed his legs and propped his head up on one arm as he commented, &ldquo;My, my Femme Boy&mdash;you&rsquo;re <em>full</em> of surprises tonight, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was supposed to reply, so I just gave a one-armed shrug. He snorted a little, smirking before he continued, &ldquo;It depends on how you define &lsquo;kill&rsquo;, and what &lsquo;us&rsquo; means.&rdquo; His eyes were fully awake, now. &ldquo;If you define &lsquo;kill&rsquo; as &lsquo;murder&rsquo;, then I&rsquo;ve probably killed Jimmy..&rdquo; He glanced upward thoughtfully, moving his hand in a so-so gesture before snapping back to me. &ldquo;..Oh, a few hundred times?&rdquo; My expression must&rsquo;ve changed, because he added, almost patronizingly, &ldquo;<em>ish</em>! Sheesh. That&rsquo;s probably a high-ball guess, anyway. As for how many times I <em>caused</em> your or Jimmy&rsquo;s death, that&rsquo;s probably&ndash;  &rdquo;   I shook my head. I don&rsquo;t want to hear this! </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Stop, I&ndash;I don&rsquo;t wanna know&hellip;&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s eyes narrowed and I flinched a little; shit, I should <em>not</em> have said that! </p>
<p  >To my surprise, though, he just shrugged and said, &ldquo;Alrighty, then,&rdquo; before lying back with his hands behind his head, staring at the celling. That&rsquo;s it? Oh well, I wasn&rsquo;t one to look a gift horse in the mouth. I just laid down on top of the covers, grabbing the only pillow left. Gary quietly added, &ldquo;&lsquo;night, Petey. See ya tomorrow,&rdquo; A shudder ran through my body at the threatening implication. </p>
<p  >I tried to keep myself awake by thinking of ways to escape&mdash;but I was too tired to keep my eyes open. Eventually my thought process ended up repeating the same idea; I have to keep us safe, no matter what. Then I was gone. </p>
</div>

<div class="garyBox">
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 3: The Morning After~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >To my surprise, I actually fell asleep after Petey&rsquo;s little midnight question. I awoke to the sounds of birds singing, somebody crunching on what sounded like a bowl of cereal, and a quiet discussion I couldn&rsquo;t quite make out. I rolled my eyes; three guesses what those two were discussing, and none of them count because it&rsquo;s fucking obvious. I threw the covers off and swung out of bed, yelling &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake, kiddos&mdash;time to stop planning your escape!&rdquo; That stopped the talking dead in its tracks. I slid the door open and made my way for the food cabinet&mdash;we have enough for a couple days, but I&rsquo;m far less familiar with the actual  <em> travel </em>  portion of the trip than the preparation phase. Of course, I&rsquo;d done this a bunch without these two, otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t have had the faintest clue where to go. It was more a matter of ironing out the wrinkles that Jimmy and Petey would add to the equation at this point. </p>
<p  >I shook my head, bringing myself back to the present as I pulled down a box of frosted flakes before turning in the direction of the moron. Unsurprisingly, his mouth was duct tape-free. Petey had yet to go a loop without taking the gag off during the first night. I grinned, reaching over to grab a bowl from the other cabinet; time to put the moron in his place. &ldquo;Aw, wassa matter, didn&rsquo;t you like your muzzle, Jim-jam?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy didn&rsquo;t like that, no sir. &ldquo;Go fuck yourself, psycho.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes as I shook the cereal into the bowl. &ldquo;Oh, Jimmy, your insulting my mental health is so <em>cutting</em>,&rdquo; I grabbed a few flakes, giving Jimbo my best patronizing smirk. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know any better I&rsquo;d think you <em>knew</em> that I would be locked up in a mental institution if it weren&rsquo;t for the time travel crap!&rdquo; I steeled myself and gave Petey a momentary scan&mdash;to my relief, he looked much better than he had at the same point in previous loops. Perhaps the question he&rsquo;d asked last night? Or something I&rsquo;d done during the bj? I looked back to Jimmy, trying to hide the burst of giddiness that flared in my stomach at that. I had a feeling this was going to be an excellent run. </p>
<p  >Meanwhile, the court jester was busy rolling his eyes at my &lsquo;time travel&rsquo;   comment.   &ldquo;Yeah right, that&rsquo;s such a load of bullshit. You&rsquo;re just a fucking psychopath,&rdquo; I grinned as I crunched on some more flakes&mdash;breakfast <em>and</em> a show, what could be better? Jimmy-boy paused before adding &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind that murders people all the time, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey did the thing where he furrows his eyebrows because he&rsquo;s pretty sure somebody&rsquo;s talking out their ass but he doesn&rsquo;t want to call them out on it. &ldquo;Uh, I&rsquo;m not sure.... I think a psychopath is.. somebody who can&rsquo;t feel empathy?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;A psychopath is somebody who can&rsquo;t feel remorse or fear,&rdquo; I crunched on a few more flakes as the two turned toward me. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re able to murder people so easily&mdash;they don&rsquo;t feel empathy for the person, <em>and</em> they&rsquo;re not scared of the consequences, like jail and what-not,&rdquo; I gave Jimmy a semi-bored look as I chewed for a couple seconds to let that thought sink in before continuing. &ldquo;  So, no. I  &rsquo;m not a psychopath. Sure, I&rsquo;m not afraid of the consequences of my actions, what with the time loop thing. But I <em>do</em> feel empathy for others,&rdquo; I paused, considering my wording before shrugging and adding &ldquo;Well, the people that <em>matter</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey&rsquo;s brow furrowed in confusion as it so often does. &ldquo;What do you mean? Why would one person matter more?&rdquo; I raised an eyebrow as I lifted more not-frosted flakes. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re <em>better</em> everybody else, Petey. Obviously.&rdquo; He looked stricken, and like he was going to continue arguing with me, but Jimmy-boy decided to intervene at that moment. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Hey, Special Ed, I need your <em>totally not psycho</em> ass to let me take a piss,&rdquo; I glanced over, and sure enough he looked like he was trying to hold it in. It <em>had</em> been a while since he&rsquo;d gone&mdash;before I&rsquo;d first locked him up in the police cruiser, for sure. </p>
<p  >I smiled. Ah, Jimmy  &rsquo;s annual attempt at an escape plan. I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting much from him the rest of the loop if <em>this</em> was the best he could do. &ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; His eyebrows shot up at that&mdash;I could see the two of them make eye-contact as I got up. </p>
<p  >The moron blanched when I made my way over to the flatware cabinet, though. &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m over here, asshole,&rdquo; I hm&rsquo;d, trying to remember where the kettle was. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Just a &lsquo;mo, Jimbo, I&rsquo;m looking&mdash;aha, here we go!&rdquo; I pulled it out and walked over to him, kneeling down and moving to undo his zipper. I smirked when he obviously tried to kick me in the face. The duct-tape held fast, though. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What the <em>fuck</em>!? Get the fuck away from me!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I pulled my hand away from the zipper. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m <em>sorry</em>&mdash;would you prefer Petey did it?&rdquo; And I gestured in Femme Boy&rsquo;s general direction with the kettle. </p>
<p  >Jimmy turned his full-force Murder face on me at that. &ldquo;  No.  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >I grinned. &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to do, won&rsquo;  t I?  &rdquo;  </p>
<p  >Jimmy underwent what I&rsquo;m sure was a fascinating inner battle of wills before finally looking away and growling &ldquo;Just fucking do it, asshole.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I smirked. &ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; I resumed pulling down the zipper, and dug around for his penis for a bit before pulling it out and watching the stream of liquid start to flow. The silence that fills a room when a container is being publicly filled with urine continued for a few seconds before I added, &ldquo;You know that escape plan literally never worked once?&rdquo; I smirked up at him, but he had his eyes squeezed shut. I continued anyway, snickering to myself. &ldquo;Not even the first time you tried it,&rdquo; The stream eventually trickled to a stop and I was able to tuck him back in before straightening up and heading over to the bathroom to empty the kettle. While doing so, I mentally reviewed the itinerary for today&mdash;we were getting close to the point where I&rsquo;d fucked up last&mdash;they&rsquo;d ditched me in the middle of the woods at an abandoned cabin I&rsquo;d found, so I&rsquo;d had to stab myself and start over. I exited the bathroom, putting the kettle in the sink, sighing as I went to pull out the map. Time to start navigating. </p>

<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 4: Blown Up~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I inhaled deeply, letting the sound of crickets and croaking frogs wash over me as I gazed up at the stars. We were <em>six days</em> in and everybody is still alive and safely under lock and key! That&rsquo;s a fucking  <em> RECORD! </em>  Granted there were still three weeks left for everything to fall to shit, not to mention this was only my sixth run-through of course, but I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s a good idea to celebrate the small victories when you can. </p>
<p  >I sighed in annoyance as I wiped off yet more sweat that was tricking down the back of my neck. W  e had made it to the upper South, and I have to seriously question whatever naming committee decided to call it <em>that</em> because they should have called it &lsquo;Muggy as Fuck&rsquo;. It was so hot at night that I&rsquo;d started dragging Petey to sleep outside&mdash;which I was surprised to discover he enjoys immensely. When he found out I know a lot about astronomy (you try reading every book in the entire town of Bullworth and see if you don&rsquo;t learn anything about space), he started asking me a zillion question about everything. We sat around talking for hours after dark&mdash;tonight Petey had fallen asleep after a simple question had turned into a three-hour lecture about black holes and quantum mechanics. I couldn&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d actually listened for so long. We&rsquo;d lain down on the picnic table at the &lsquo;camp site&rsquo; I&rsquo;d parked on, and&mdash;upon closer examination&mdash;he looked really uncomfortable splayed all out like that. </p>
<p  >I&rsquo;d scaled back the sex stuff, focusing on more PG stuff in &lsquo;public&rsquo; (i.e. in front of Jimmy fake-gaging), with just a smattering of the occasional hands-under-shirt. I couldn&rsquo;t let Petey think I was just going to hold him down and fuck him, no, no, no. The blowjob is important in establishing that I want him, of course; but it also shows him that it doesn&rsquo;t need to be terrible. The less &lsquo;sexual&rsquo; public displays of affection help ease him into the idea, make it feel normal. Plus I love the feeling of closeness that comes with casual contact like hugging or holding hands or light pecks on the cheek. The under-shirt groping&hellip; well, I <em>have</em> a libido. Luckily, it&rsquo;d been low-key enough that he hadn&rsquo;t responded too badly. We hadn&rsquo;t taken shirts off yet or anything, but my patience seems to be paying off; Petey isn&rsquo;t nearly as twitchy around me as he was last week. Logically, this slow, steady drip of pushing boundaries is the best chance I have for emulating the intimacy I want. &hellip;But as I watched, he shifted and his shirt began riding up. I licked my lips&mdash;he was wearing the shorts I&rsquo;d bought him the other day, too. They aren&rsquo;t revealing or anything, but Petey trusting me enough to wear them&mdash;that&rsquo;s a heady feeling. I licked my lips, scanning the newly-exposed strip of flesh. </p>
<p  >Ah, fuck it&mdash;this <em>is</em> the point of doing this whole thing, anyhow. I shifted so I was closer and began ghosting my fingers over his stomach. It was strange what a little bit of light could do; I&rsquo;d touched the same skin yesterday, but without the visual element it was all very abstract. With the full moon, though&hellip; I ran my tongue over my upper lip as my saliva glands began working overtime. Checking to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t waking up, I straddled him as carefully as possible. </p>
<p  >I started carefully pulling his shirt up to expose more of his chest&mdash;my heart-rate kicked up another notch. Petey may not be muscular, but his skin is smooth and <em>soft</em>. I made sure to appreciate this fact as I slid my hands over his nipples&mdash;my skin was ghostly white compared to his. I rested a hand at the center of his chest, using the other to trace patterns on his abdomen. I held my breath for a second when I felt his heart beating; a moment later, I let out a breathy exhale. Man, being able to feel that directly is so <em>good</em>. I stayed still for a while, just feeling his heartbeat&mdash;but suddenly, it started speeding up. I opened my eyes to check that he was still asleep. </p>
<p  >He wasn&rsquo;t. I froze, like a deer caught in the headlights. The fear had returned, but it wasn&rsquo;t as overwhelming as I&rsquo;d been dreading. He swallowed before shifting his gaze from me to his own chest and back, which made him sigh for some reason. The mystery of Femme Boy&mdash;who knows what goes on in that head of his. </p>
<p  >He closed his eyes and took a deep breath that I felt fill his chest before actually propping himself up to take his shirt fully off. I couldn&rsquo;t help a gleeful grin at that&mdash;Petey doing something I want without prompt is <em>always</em> cause for celebration. When he was done, he still moved to fold the thing! That made me chuckle&mdash;typical Femme Boy. He shot me a worried glance when I laughed, which was less than ideal. So I leaned forward, pressing my face right up to his, gently prying the shirt out of his hands and letting it fall to the ground in a messy heap. </p>
<p  >I breathed in deeply as I pressed my lips to whatever part of his face I could ,trying to brand everything about him in this moment into my memory. I wrapped my hand around his as I kissed his forehead, his eyelids, the tip of his nose, his cheeks&hellip; pulling back a little, I could taste a little bit of left over sweat from the day&rsquo;s heat. Against my logical mind&rsquo;s better judgement, I flicked my gaze up to meet his as I brought his hand up to kiss the scar there. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some stupid sonnet about some dead guy&rsquo;s girlfriend&rsquo;s eyes in the moonlight floating around out there, but Petey&rsquo;s eyes really are very pretty. They&rsquo;re a lovely, warm brown that I think a lot of people would find damn attractive. I made a mental note to do this during the day, too&mdash;that way I could compare. Cupping his face in my hands, I leaned down and started slowly licking his lips, a signal I&rsquo;d actually had to <em>explain</em> once we&rsquo;d gotten to that point. </p>
<p  >Petey opened his mouth almost immediately, and I tried not to think about the fact that it was only because I&rsquo;d told him to. I took my time&mdash;slowly massaging his tongue with mine, exploring the texture of the roof of his mouth, all that good stuff, all the while letting the tingling slowly radiate from my mouth down my neck until soon my whole body felt like it was lit up like a tesla coil. As I let myself get lost, I pressed him against the table, trying to get some sort of rise out of him. He was unresponsive for the most part, until I slid my hand over the front of his shorts and he let out a startled squeak, pushing me away. </p>
<p  >I tried to resist the temptation to sigh&mdash;figures I&rsquo;m in love with the only fifteen-year-old boy in the world who <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> want somebody to jerk him off. I stayed still as Petey caught his breath before his expression abruptly shifted to horrified. His mouth opened and closed for a few moments, before almost whispering &ldquo;I&ndash;I don&rsquo;t want..&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I had heard all I needed&mdash;time for a distraction. Leaning back and moving my legs out of the way, I spoke casually, like I totally wasn&rsquo;t imagining him coming all over my face. &ldquo;You know, Femme Boy&hellip;&rdquo; He started at that, but I kept my eyes locked on him as I continued, &ldquo;In some cultures it&rsquo;s considered a capital offense to not return a blowjob,&rdquo; I undid the top button on my shorts and let the pyramid of cloth do my talking for me. </p>
<p  >Lately I&rsquo;ve been discovering the <em>other</em> side effect of constantly saying shocking things to people; eventually they no longer find them shocking. Petey closed his eyes and sighed deeply, like he&rsquo;d had his fears confirmed. Snapping his eyes open again, he went from my erection to my face before settling on the trailer, no doubt thinking about the snoozing King of the Morons. &ldquo;  Capital   offense  , huh?  &rdquo; He licked his lips nervously (a new habit rarely seen in Femme Boys) before glancing back to me for confirmation. I gave a tight-lipped smile. He knew <em>exactly</em> what I was saying&mdash;I just hate the reminder that he&rsquo;s only doing this for Jimmy. He bit his lip as he scanned the tabletop. &ldquo;I, uh, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be any good&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off, pointedly fixing his eyes on my face as he adopted a pleading expression. </p>
<p  >I shrugged. &ldquo;Probably not, but as long as you don&rsquo;t do anything stupid like bite it&rsquo;ll be fine,&rdquo; I snickered as a ridiculously cheesy thought occurred to me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <em>you</em> doing it, so that&rsquo;ll be more than enough,&rdquo; To my surprise, Petey didn&rsquo;t look utterly disgusted by that comment&mdash;rather, it was more&hellip; <em>fuck</em>, was that <em>pity</em>? I shifted forward, glaring now. &ldquo;Today, Femme Boy? You wouldn&rsquo;t wanna hit puberty in the middle of it.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >That wiped the fucking <em>sympathy</em> from his face all right. &ldquo;Okay, okay&mdash;  geez  &hellip;&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t move from his spot for a few moments, instead unwrapping his arms from around his knees and breathing in deeply a couple of times. Then he started crawling tentatively in my direction. Now <em>that</em> was fucking hot. I kept my expression carefully neutral, though&mdash;I was already pushing Petey far, <em>far</em> out of his comfort zone; best to not make it, ahem, harder than it needed to be for him. He reached out uncertainly, before looking back up at me, his voice gaining a bit of a desperate edge. &ldquo;Um, aren&rsquo;t you supposed to brush your teeth before you do this or something??...&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I sighed; guess I had to hold his hand, as per usual. &ldquo;Petey, relax. Here&hellip;  &rdquo;   I got up onto my knees and started guiding him backward, explaining while I moved us. &ldquo;&hellip;if you&rsquo;re at a lower elevation, you&rsquo;ll have easier access, &lsquo;mkay?&rdquo; Now that he was occupied with maneuvering down to kneel on the seat of the table he seemed to be a bit less panicky. Maybe I could lean into that&mdash;after all, it&rsquo;s just actions, nothing more. &ldquo;Probably best to start slow with just your hands,&rdquo; I helped him lower himself onto the bench. &ldquo;And once you move past that, don&rsquo;t start trying to take in the whole thing, you know?&rdquo; Petey nodded automatically; he had his hands flat on the table, and he appeared to be trying to stare my erection down. Well, that was an improvement over being unable to look at it, I guess. &ldquo;And put a lot of focus on the tip&mdash;that&rsquo;s probably your best bet,&rdquo; I tried to slowly plant my feet on his either side&mdash;didn&rsquo;t want him to feel caged-in or anything. I mean, he <em>was</em>, in reality. But I hate considering reality when thinking of Petey anyway, so. </p>
<p  >He finally snapped out of his little staring contest and seemed to realize just where he was. I wasn&rsquo;t privy to his inner thoughts, since his face cycled through a variety of expressions so quickly that I wasn&rsquo;t able to catch what they were. Eventually he squeezed his eyes shut (again) for a few seconds, shaking his head and muttering, &ldquo;Oh, fuck it&rdquo; before reaching out to unbutton my boxers. I leaned back, resting my weight on my hands and seriously reigning in the temptation to touch him. While watching how he kept fumbling with the buttons, it occurred to me that maybe I should go get a condom; I&rsquo;d thrown some in the backpack on a lark, but I&rsquo;ve never gotten far enough with him to see how he feels about it. </p>
<p  >The concentration in Petey&rsquo;s face was making it tough to be impartial; for all of his bravado, he blanched hard when faced with a naked cock. But he gave a small shrug and went for it with a slurp. Deliberation on the condom issue stopped while I threw my head back and exhaled sharply&mdash;&ldquo;  Mmmm!  &rdquo;&mdash;<em>holy fuck</em> that felt good. Then it stopped. I looked back down and he was just staring, <em>not fucking touching me</em>. &ldquo;What the fuck did you stop for, shit-for-brains!?&rdquo;   Jesus,   blowing somebody isn&rsquo;t fucking rocket science! </p>
<p  >He flinched, adding a quick, &ldquo;  Sorry!  &rdquo; before resuming his task. I squeezed my eyes shut, since the combination of tactile and visual stimuli would&rsquo;ve sent me right over the edge, and I wanted this to last as long as possible; who <strong>knows</strong> when I&rsquo;ll get an opportunity like it again? </p>
<p  >He began at the tip this time, distributing smaller licks all along the shaft. It also became apparent that he had no clue what the hell he was doing; after my outburst he went back at it quickly, but ran out of steam pretty fast. I whined&mdash;his licking was so <em>tentative</em>, I started gripping the edge of the table to keep from just grabbing him and shoving his head deeper. &ldquo;Nehh, come <em>on</em>, don&rsquo;t be such a fucking <em>tease</em>!&rdquo; That caused a momentary pause before he sighed&mdash;the gust of air flowing over the moist skin made me shudder. I tried to catch my breath a little, not sure if I should risk opening an eye to check on him. Maybe the condom thing wasn&rsquo;t such a bad idea.... A second later, I felt warm fingers wrap around my shaft. I let out an involuntary shudder accompanied by a quiet moan; he was touching me and it wasn&rsquo;t just somebody else that I was pretending was Petey it was <em>actually him</em>. &ldquo;  Oooooh  <em> fuck </em>  yesssss&hellip;&rdquo; He started speeding up his pumping, but his grip was so loose that I couldn&rsquo;t get very much friction out of it. Whining again, I started shifting my hips so I could rub against his hand harder. Paradoxically, this made him withdraw&mdash;I snapped my eyes open to see him leaning away. &ldquo;Nononono! Petey, <em>please</em>&hellip;&rdquo; He looked between me and my dick, looking more desperate each time. I frowned&mdash;was this <em>really</em> so much to ask? I&rsquo;ve blown people I wasn&rsquo;t attracted to <em>plenty</em> of times; did he really need to get so hung up about this? &ldquo;Come <em>on</em> Femme Boy&mdash;it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;ll bite.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He glanced up at that before letting out a small laugh. &ldquo;Guess <em>that</em> nick-name is pretty appropriate right now,&rdquo; That threw me for a bit of a loop; I&rsquo;ve called him that for so long, it&rsquo;s hard to even think of it as an insult anymore. He closed his eyes <em>again</em> and took another deep breath before opening his eyes and quickly slipping the tip in his mouth. </p>
<p  >I inhaled sharply&mdash;I&rsquo;d been very correct to assume that the sight of Petey going down on me would be fucking hot. Unfortunately, he didn&rsquo;t do anything for a couple more seconds, like he was just trying to get used to having something in his mouth. I groaned, mentally debating pushing his head further along; but that would risk making him even twitchier in the coming few weeks.... Luckily, I didn&rsquo;t have to, since he started moving his tongue experimentally. I let my muscles relax&mdash;he was doing what I wanted, everything was okay. I added a verbal element, just to make sure things were clearer for him. &ldquo;Mmmm yeah, that&rsquo;s great&hellip;&rdquo; He started by rubbing the tip of his tongue on the end, then curling it around to the top of the shaft. It was still slow going, but I could live with that; boy, I was glad I hadn&rsquo;t mentioned the condom thing, that was for sure. </p>
<p  >I kept my eyes open as well, since he clearly wasn&rsquo;t in any hurry to finish this up. It was kind of hard to see in the dark, but I could just make out that his brow was heavily furrowed. I grinned privately to myself; of all the times to use his thinking face! I made another mental note to buy a lamp or something for this next time around. He opened his mouth wider now, and I could feel him lick the underside of my dick. I shuddered again, this time the intimacy making my dick twitch as it got even harder. He flinched back at that, like he was surprised at the movement. I snickered. &ldquo;Sheesh Petey, you act like you&rsquo;ve never seen a penis in your life!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He scowled and pulled back despite my disappointed whine. If I&rsquo;d known he was going to try to <em>reply</em>, I wouldn&rsquo;t have said anything! Holding up a finger, he said, &ldquo;Okay first of all, didn&rsquo;t you <em>literally</em> just call me &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo;?&rdquo; He tilted his head and closed his eyes as if he were preparing to speak again, pausing for a few moments before he added, &ldquo;And I forgot the other thing I was gonna say because this situation is <em>too fucking ridiculous</em>!&rdquo; He began to laugh a little hysterically and bury his face in his hands. </p>
<p  >I was tempted to slap myself in the face at that. Of all the things he had just been doing, me calling him by his pet name was what got him to have a breakdown? &ldquo;Come on, just because I call you &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean I actually believe you&rsquo;re female, Petey,&rdquo; I rolled my eyes before re-establishing eye-contact. &ldquo;Anyway, don&rsquo;t you have a job to do?&rdquo; I nudged my leg against him pointedly. </p>
<p  >He brought his hand back from his face, giving my turgid member a wary glance before looking at me uncertainly. &ldquo;Do I have to get any.. um.. stuff in my mouth, or?...&rdquo; Oh, that wasn&rsquo;t a bad question. </p>
<p  >I thought about it for a second, then said in a serious voice &ldquo;Petey, I promise you; if I get your mouth pregnant, I will raise the children.&rdquo; He blinked, getting his &lsquo;processing&rsquo; face on before he snorted and started giggling. I smirked a little&mdash;humor to relieve tension, check. Petey <em>giggling</em> was just a nice bonus. Continuing as his laughing died down I added, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to swallow or anything; I&rsquo;d just say to keep it a <em>blow</em>job.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He nodded slowly, letting out a determined exhale. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; He reached forward, stroking me harder now. I gritted my teeth, letting my breath hiss. Fucking <em>hell</em>, the increased confidence just reminded me that he really had <em>never</em> done this before and God that was sort of cute. My train of thought (such as it was) paused when he asked, &ldquo;Hey, um. So, am I any good?&rdquo; He kept stroking while he asked, though&mdash;so it took me a few moments to process what he&rsquo;d said. </p>
<p  >I swallowed, breathing heavily. &ldquo;Uhhh.. I..&rdquo; Petey slowed down, mild surprise on his face. Well now, there was a question. &ldquo;I would say that&hellip; you could use some practice.&rdquo; His face fell a little, which made me laugh. &ldquo;Aw, disappointed, Petey?&rdquo; He shot me a pained look and groaned before rolling his eyes and shaking his head, like he wasn&rsquo;t even sure what to say. After closing his eyes for a moment, he licked his lips before quickly leaning forward again and taking in a mouthful of dick. &ldquo;MMmm ohhh man&rdquo; I snickered to myself as I moaned, shifting forward a little into his mouth. Was he seriously trying to prove me wrong? </p>
<p  >He swirled his tongue around the head, and I swallowed dryly as his brows furrowed in concentration. It should be illegal for a sight to be that erotic. Unfortunately, his physical technique left more than a little to be desired. &ldquo;You know, Femme Boy&hellip;&rdquo; He glanced up, and started shifting back to talk but I grabbed the back of his head. &ldquo;No, no!&mdash;just.. perhaps try stroking <em>and</em> sucking? At the same time?&rdquo; I loosened my grip, running my hand through his hair a bit before pulling away. </p>
<p  >He actually nodded at that, which was rather funny since he still had my dick in his mouth. Then he added a hand in <em>addition</em> to the sucking he had now started, my grip tightened on the table again&mdash;but this time it was because what he was doing was so fucking <em>good</em> and he&rsquo;d actually <em>listened to me</em>. &ldquo;Oh yes yeah mmmm likethatOhfuck&rdquo; He&rsquo;d started synching up the movement of his hand with the sucking and oh it was exactly what I wanted. I squeezed my eyes shut&mdash;I was definitely getting close now; best to draw it out. My imagination started to run wild; maybe he liked it, maybe he&rsquo;d be willing to do this again, maybe I could get him to stay without forcing him, maybe I could get him to love me, maybe I could, maybe, maybe.... At some point, I started seeing white even with my eyes firmly shut. &ldquo;Ahh oh shit I&rsquo;m gonna~&rdquo; But at that moment, Petey inexplicably decided to slow his pace and remove his hands. &ldquo;Wha&mdash;h-hey!&rdquo; I popped my eyes back open to see him pulling away, defiance burning in his eyes. </p>
<p  >Petey has always been an utterly unique entity in my world. Before this stupid &lsquo;  project  &rsquo;, before I&rsquo;d figured out I was attracted him, even before the time loops. My memories before the loops feel, if you&rsquo;ll forgive me, a million miles away. But I distinctly remember thinking about him quite a bit, even back then. For somebody that wasn&rsquo;t really part of my social circle, not being neighbors or classmates with him, I thought about him an awful lot&mdash;even considered him a &lsquo;friend&rsquo; in my own stupid way. Petey has always been <em>special</em>; someone willing to put up with my bullshit, someone who&rsquo;s different from all the fucking morons I&rsquo;m constantly surrounded by, someone I can&rsquo;t control even though by all rights he should just be another easily-manipulated idiot trying to &lsquo;do the right thing&rsquo;. So of <em>course</em> Petey would fight back in his own incomprehensible way. God, it was so utterly, completely <em>Femme Boy</em> that I fucking lost it right there. </p>
<p  >Poor Petey got no warning, since even I didn&rsquo;t realize what was happening. &ldquo;  Gah!   &hellip;ew, what the hell!?&rdquo; He started furiously wiping the white gunk off his face and shaking it off onto the floor. I exhaled, breathing hard, trying to let my brain catch up to what was going on. He didn&rsquo;t even glance my way as he scrambled off the bench and rushed into the trailer. I felt my breathing slow, and the post-coitus hormones slowly drain away. </p>
<p  >The door banged shut and I could soon hear distant sounds of running water. After all that, I don&rsquo;t know why I was surprised by the hollowed-out feeling left over. I redid my boxers and pants, letting the familiar cold grip of rejection compress my chest in the muggy, cricket-laden landscape. </p>

<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 5: Jimmy Gets His Two Cents in~~~~~~&lt;PoV: Jimmy&gt; </p>
<p  >It was a couple of days after I&rsquo;d woken up in the middle of the night to the sound of somebody making puking noises in the bathroom. I&rsquo;d spent a <em>fucking</em> hour trying to get Pete to come out and just talk to me, but he&rsquo;d refused. Judging by the bounce in the psycho&rsquo;s step the next day, I could guess what had gone down&mdash;or who. </p>
<p  >Right now the schitzo was packing up to leave&mdash;we needed more supplies or something, and he&rsquo;d apparently parked us near a town where he could get more. Grabbing his last bag, the lunatic actually pecked Pete on the cheek&mdash;like he was his fucking <em>wife</em> or some shit!&mdash;before getting the fuck out. We waited for a few minutes, listening to the crunching of gravel get quieter. I let out a sigh of relief when I couldn&rsquo;t hear anything anymore. &ldquo;Finally! Christ, I thought he&rsquo;d never fucking leave.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Pete nodded as he knelt down to undo what duct-tape he could. I&rsquo;d stopped trying to convince him to get out of here without me; if it&rsquo;d been the other way around, I couldn&rsquo;t have left him behind either. &ldquo;Yeah, I know,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t see his face as he was undoing the tape, but he sounded distracted as he added, &ldquo;He also needs to do laundry so he knows it&rsquo;s going to take longer than usual; he was probably stalling....&rdquo; He trailed off as he moved out of the way to let me move my legs around. Fuck, I can feel the two weeks without moving; I can barely even lift my legs up to sit cross-legged on my chair. </p>
<p  >I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about that, though; I had more important shit to worry about. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah&hellip;&rdquo; How should I bring up the midnight barfing session? Tact isn&rsquo;t really my thing, but he&rsquo;s been even more quiet than usual&mdash;he&rsquo;d had trouble sleeping the last two nights too, and I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that wasn&rsquo;t just gonna stop.   Ah, fuck it.   &ldquo;So&hellip; what was throwing up in the bathroom the other night about?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d have to talk about it sometime. He stiffened as he sat down at the table across from my chair. </p>
<p  >Then, he sighed. He kept his back really stiff as he replied. &ldquo;&hellip;I&hellip; gave Gary a blowjob.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I narrowed my eyes. Fuckin&rsquo; called it&mdash;what a <em>monster</em>. &ldquo;You mean he <em>made</em> jy&rsquo;a blow him,&rdquo; Pete glanced at me for like two seconds before nodding and going back to staring at nothing. After a minute of nothing but awkward silence, I figured he wasn&rsquo;t gonna say anything. &ldquo;&hellip;what&rsquo;s on your mind, dude?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >It was more of a &lsquo;thinking hard&rsquo; face than a traumatized face, though. Pete started slowly, saying somewhat uncertainly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&hellip; been thinking lately.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snorted. &ldquo;Shit, should I be worried?&rdquo; That got him to smile, at least. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;No&mdash;well&hellip; maybe. Just&hellip; hear me out, okay?&rdquo; Now I really <em>was</em> worried. Sounded like a Talk was brewing. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&lsquo;Kay&hellip;&rdquo; I braced myself. For what I had no idea, but&hellip; just. Yeah. </p>
<p  >He took a deep breath before continuing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should simply&hellip;  <em> escape </em>  from Gary.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He pasued, and scanned my face like he was worried I was gonna get mad. &ldquo;..uh, okay? What&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Then he made a weird face, like he was relieved and worried or something. &ldquo;Well, you see..&rdquo; He shifted uncomfortably and glanced at the door to the bedroom. &ldquo;Gary&rsquo;s clearly mentally unstable, buuut he <em>can</em> be reasoned with if you know how, right?&rdquo; He leaned his head toward me, and I nodded grudgingly. &ldquo;..But the only people who actually know what his deal is are you and me. It doesn&rsquo;t seem likely that Gary&rsquo;s going to try to explain his &lsquo;time loop&rsquo; &hellip;thing to anybody else, so that means we&rsquo;re the only two people who actually kind of get his motivations.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I couldn&rsquo;t help but snort at that. &ldquo;Speak for yourself, Pete. Ya can&rsquo;t understand why somebody that insane does what they do.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He frowned. &ldquo;I guess.. but do you get what I&rsquo;m saying?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shook my head. &ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; Was I still supposed to be worried or what? </p>
<p  >&ldquo;  Well  &hellip; let me put it this way; If we just ditched Gary, he&rsquo;d become <em>way</em> more dangerous, wouldn&rsquo;t   he?  &rdquo; I scrunched up my face, not totally sure how the psycho could be <em>more</em> dangerous than he already was. He saw my confusion and turned toward me to elaborate. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say we were able to escape, right now. What do you think Gary&rsquo;d   do?  &rdquo; I blinked. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;I dunno?&rdquo; I automatically tried to move my hand to scratch my hair. &nbsp;&ldquo;Without you, masturbate I guess?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He twisted his face in disgust, rolling his eyes. &ldquo;Gosh, thanks for <em>that</em> mental image, Jimmy. I mean that he&rsquo;d get <em>mad</em>. Right?&rdquo; I nodded. &ldquo;Okay, so after that, if I were him, I bet I&rsquo;d look at the stuff I just went through all the trouble of getting from the nearby town and be <em>especially</em> pissed, you know?&rdquo; I nodded again, more slowly this time. Where was he going with this? He took a breath, and got quieter. &ldquo;If&hellip; if I were Gary, I&rsquo;d probably go and&hellip; hurt somebody to take out my frustration.&rdquo; &hellip;oh. Fuck. &ldquo;Maybe the people I just stole from, even....&rdquo; Pete rubbed his arm, like he&rsquo;d just felt a chill. </p>
<p  >I grunted. &ldquo;Okay, okay. I get what you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo;.&rdquo; We sat in silence for a little while and processed his idea. &ldquo;But if we can get out, we&rsquo;re still getting out, right?&rdquo; That made him bite his lip. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; kind of what I&rsquo;m saying. If we can find a way to get <em>you</em> out of here, I think we should do it&hellip; but I think it would be better if I stayed with Gary to keep him in check.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What!? What the fuck, Pete?&rdquo; I automatically moved to gesture, but I just ended up tugging on the handcuffs. &ldquo;Are you starting to <em>like</em> being a fucking sex slave?!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >His jaw actually dropped at that before he gave me a pissed-off glare. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;NO, I&rsquo;m NOT. Would you just <em>listen</em>!?&rdquo;   .   &ldquo;Look, I get it, and I want to get out of here just as bad as you do, okay? But I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> just leave Gary to his own devices without knowing if he&rsquo;s going to hurt other people because of me..&rdquo; He looked me in the eye. &ldquo;Would you really be willing to let some innocent person get hurt because of you?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I thought about it for a second. &ldquo;If it meant us gettin&rsquo; away from Coocoo for Coco Puffs, then yeah! I care about <em>you</em>, and I care about <em>me</em>. Everybody else can go fuck themselves,&rdquo; He looked at me in silent horror for a full minute. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Y-you don&rsquo;t <em>care</em> that Gary might go around stabbing random people?&rdquo; I shrugged. Not my problem. He stuttered for a bit before shouting, &ldquo;What, it doesn&rsquo;t  <em> matter </em>  that Gary could turn around and do to somebody else the same shit he&rsquo;s put you and me through!?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Not my problem.&rdquo; The silence was weirdly heavy. Then I huffed, adding, &ldquo;Come on Pete, let&rsquo;s get real&mdash;we&rsquo;re <em>not</em> going through the same shit.&rdquo; Pete stopped at that, frowning in worry. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; His face turned all hurt and he scooted closer to me. &ldquo;I&hellip; thought we were in this together?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I sighed, not meeting his eye. &ldquo;Look, I know what you&rsquo;re going through isn&rsquo;t <em>easy</em>, but you&rsquo;re not the one that has to <em>piss</em> in a fucking <em>teapot</em>, okay!?&rdquo; Pete curled up in his seat, and I could tell he felt bad for the casual way he&rsquo;d moved just now&mdash;a luxury I don&rsquo;t have. More heavy fucking silence. </p>
<p> Eventually, he took in a breath and straightened up, looking determined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not willing to do anything that puts anybody but me in danger. I know I can handle it; but I don&rsquo;t know about anybody else.&rdquo; He sighed sadly. &ldquo;I understand how you feel, I really do&mdash;but just know that if you <em>do</em> try and get out of here, I won&rsquo;t go without a fight.&rdquo; </p>
<p > I grunted. I could probably deal. &ldquo;Fair &lsquo;  nuff, Pete,  &rdquo; Then, to lighten the mood a bit, I added, &ldquo;I think I can take ya, though.&rdquo; That broke his Serious Face, and he snorted. </p>
<p > &ldquo;Haha, yeah, you probably could!&rdquo; And just like that, things were okay. Maybe not Okay, but I knew where Pete stood and Pete knew where I stood. For now, at any rate. </p>
</div>

<p> ~~~~~~  Chapter 6: Time for a Change~  ~~~~~ </p>
<p> I panted a little as I hauled the grocery bags up the hill to where I&rsquo;d parked the RV. I groaned in frustration&mdash;all the centuries worth of knowledge in the world wasn&rsquo;t going to make a bag of   laundry   weigh less. I shifted the bag over my shoulder so the handle wasn&rsquo;t cutting as deep into my hand. It&rsquo;s weak moments like these or when I am well and truly lost that fighting the temptation to get the moron to do these things for me gets rather tough. I&rsquo;d grown very used to having him around to do p  h  ysical fighting or other things I don&rsquo;t want to, or, dare I say it, can&rsquo;t do myself over the centuries. That was hardly possible now, though. He would use any opening I gave him to grind me into the dust, of that I had little doubt. </p>
<p > As I made my way through the wooded path, I could just make out Petey and Jimmy talking, though I couldn&rsquo;t hear the words themselves. I frowned: shit, I thought I&rsquo;d said to keep it down! There&rsquo;s a collection of houses a bit from this location&mdash;which I didn&rsquo;t want them to know, obviously, but then I had been in a rush to leave. Well, kind of&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been torn between trying to make Petey less uncomfortable and keeping my distance as of late. I&rsquo;d kept up the casual affectionate gestures, and he seemed a tad less twitchy. But either way, that blowjob was a real point of no return. I swallowed thickly as the familiar heat began pooling in my stomach at the mental image of Femme Boy with my dick in his mouth. Even with all the unfortunate expressions he&rsquo;d made, I would be recalling that memory for a long, <em>long</em> time. </p>
<p > My arms felt like they were about to fall off by now, so I dropped the bags onto the ground, rolling my shoulders. Christ, maybe I should start including a workout regimen in the prep phase! As I made my way across the clearing to the trailer, I could make out Jimmy saying, &ldquo;&hellip;she <em>totally</em> went to the principal! What a fucking bitch, am I right?&rdquo; </p>
<p > Petey was sitting in the doorway, his sketchbook propped on his knee as he replied, &ldquo;That does seem pretty unreasonable considering what you did,&rdquo; He was facing my way as I walked up, so I got to watch him tense up as he caught sight of me. Sigh. </p>
<p > The moron was inside, so he couldn&rsquo;t see me.   &ldquo;Pft, yeah. I mean, she   wore a fuckin&rsquo; bikini when she went to the beach!&rdquo; He continued talking even as Petey swallowed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get how that&rsquo;s much different from accidentally seeing her in a bra and panties, ya know?&rdquo; </p>
<p > Petey nodded in my direction as he said somewhat loudly, probably as a signal to Jimmy, &ldquo;Hey, Gary,&rdquo; Then he seemed to scan me up and down before frowning. &ldquo;Wait, I thought you were going to do laundry and stuff?&rdquo; </p>
<p > I sighed, pointing behind me at where I&rsquo;d left the bags. &ldquo;Yeah, I did. Turns out all of that is rather heavy, so I need your help.&rdquo; </p>
<p > Petey blinked at me in surprise, before snorting as he laid his sketchbook to the side and got up. &ldquo;You need <em>me</em> to help you carry stuff?&rdquo; I nodded, but he&rsquo;d already stuck his head in the trailer and said, &ldquo;Hey, be right back, okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p > The moron snorted, saying &ldquo;Not like I got anywhere else to be,&rdquo; Petey let out a sarcastic laugh before leaving to follow me. </p>
<p > We walked in silence for a few moments before entering the trees. As we did so, he took a deep breath before saying, &ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ve been thinking.&rdquo; </p>
<p > He waited for me to speak as I picked up a hamper of laundry. Eventually, I said neutrally, &ldquo;About anything in particular?&rdquo; Petey thinking is rarely a good sign. </p>
<p > He grabbed a couple bags himself before saying, &ldquo;About&hellip;&rdquo; he paused as he lifted one before abruptly dropping it. &ldquo;Crap, that&rsquo;s heavy&mdash;um, about Jimmy, mostly,&rdquo; Grunting as he lugged the couple of bags he&rsquo;d picked up across the clearing, he continued, &ldquo;I mean, if we&rsquo;re really going to be in this situation for the rest of the month or longer, he can&rsquo;t just stay in that chair all the time.&rdquo; </p>
<p > We stopped talking until we&rsquo;d dropped our bags off by the &lsquo;kitchen&rsquo;. I rolled my eyes as I did so; I had honestly expected this a little earlier. Jimmy was getting weaker by the day. As I unpacked things, I glanced pointedly at the moron. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not, Femme Boy.&rdquo; </p>
<p > He continued cautiously, &ldquo;Well, I was just&hellip; hoping you could maybe let him exercise a little?&rdquo; Even though I didn&rsquo;t look up he added, &ldquo;I mean, if he doesn&rsquo;t, something could&hellip; you know, bad medical attention and, um, stuff&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed off as I sighed and turned around, my arms crossed. </p>
<p > &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the thing, Petey: How is that my problem, exactly?&rdquo; I let that sink in before adding, &ldquo;If you want me to do something as stupid as letting the moron go, you&rsquo;re going to have to sweeten the deal quite a bit.&rdquo; </p>
<p > He blinked, frowning in thought for a second. However, his contemplation was cut short by Jimmy, who suddenly piped up. &ldquo;Whoa, whoa! Come on, Pete, it&rsquo;s fine, I can handle it!&rdquo; He glared at me; seemed <em>he&rsquo;d</em> caught on to what I meant. </p>
<p > Petey, meanwhile, sighed and said, &ldquo;Jimmy, you can&rsquo;t just not move, you could get seriously hurt!&rdquo; He was right, as always. Honestly, Jimmy was lucky he hadn&rsquo;t gotten a blood clot yet&mdash;people get blood clots on flights to Hawaii, and those are only a few hours long. </p>
<p > Jimmy scoffed, giving Petey an incredulous look. &ldquo;Come <em>on</em>, Pete! The psycho just wants you to suck his dick again,&rdquo; He stiffened at that&mdash;I sighed, but forced myself to keep an eye on his expression. This was bound to happen; it was what I wanted, after all. </p>
<p > To my surprise Petey gave me an apprising look before giving a thoughtful, &ldquo;&hellip;Oh!&rdquo; He then looked thoughtful. &ldquo;That actually makes a lot of sense..&rdquo; </p>
<p > I felt my heartbeat speed up a little. &ldquo;R-really?&rdquo; </p>
<p > Petey shrugged, &ldquo;If it means you&rsquo;ll let him exercise regularly, sure.&rdquo; </p>
<p > Ah, that made more sense. It was just a practical thing. </p>
<p > I tried to ignore the churning disappointment in my stomach. &ldquo;Okay, then.&rdquo; I turned around and resumed unpacking to avoid looking at him. &ldquo;What kind of arrangement would you like to set up?&rdquo; I could tell my voice was trembling, but I hoped it wasn&rsquo;t noticeable. </p>
<p> ~~~~~~  Chapter 7: Midnight Sun Madness~  ~~~~~ </p>
<p > The cicadas were chirping outside like crazy, and I could see some fireflies drifting past the window opposite my chair. &lsquo;Course, I couldn&rsquo;t really appreciate it or anything, since I was busy trying to beat my own head in as I cursed my hormones for fucking existing. Didn&rsquo;t <em>work</em>, since I only had the one pillow, but it did at least kind of drown out the squeaking of the bed from the next room. </p>
<p > You know, I&rsquo;d expected this kind of thing from the beginning; the psycho&rsquo;s clearly got a boner for Pete the size of Jupiter and has the both of us at his mercy. So it was kind of weird how literally nothing happened at first. Yeah, there was the first night, (which I could hear pretty well through the walls fuck-you-very-much) but after that? <em>Nothing</em>. So what do my hormones do? Wet dreams. Buckets of &lsquo;em. At first they&rsquo;d been pretty generic, since I was so desperate for some kind of release pretty much anything was gonna set me off at that point, but after that my subconscious decided to get fucked up. &hellip;&lsquo;Course it&rsquo;s hard to put the blame on my dreams when I was the one who&rsquo;d started imagining all the ways I could hold psycho boy down. </p>
<p > I hit my head against the pillow again, trying to cover both ears enough so that I couldn&rsquo;t hear the sounds coming from the bedroom. Jesus, does he really need to be so <em>vocal</em>? Pete can&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> good&mdash;he&rsquo;s clearly a virgin. Well, he probably isn&rsquo;t <em>now</em>, thanks to this dumbass &lsquo;sex for free time&rsquo; deal that Pete talked the psycho into&hellip; but still. God&hellip; what the fuck did I do to get a friend as nice as him, anyway? </p>
<p > Still though, I&rsquo;m kinda fucking pissed that now   I   have to listen to this shit and feel and think the <em>weirdest fucking things</em>. Like how much I wanna see the psycho on his knees making those sounds. Or be the one on my knees   mak  ing   them for   him. A particularly breathy &ldquo;yesyes<em>yes</em> mmmmmm~&hellip;&rdquo; sent my hormones into overdrive and yeah I <em>know</em> it&rsquo;s wrong to be turned on by fuckin&rsquo; <em>rape</em> but I haven&rsquo;t gotten any action in <em>weeks</em>! I groaned, squeezing my legs together. Yeah, weak fucking excuse, but I don&rsquo;t know how to make it stop; it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;d ever been a reason for me to <em>not</em> want something to turn me on. Hell, maybe this is my stupid brain&rsquo;s way of trying to make me feel less freaked out. &lsquo;See? It&rsquo;s not so scary when you can whack off to it&rsquo;. I gritted my teeth, trashing around but shit, gotta hand it to him, the psycho knows his restraints. And   i  sn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> fucking kinky. </p>
<p > Eventually I couldn&rsquo;t hear anything from the room anymore. &nbsp;Whatever, just go to sleep. Do <em>not</em> picture him chained to the chair as you face-fuck the little shit. I shook my head, like maybe I could get the image out of my head&mdash;Goddamnit, what the fuck is <em>wrong</em> with me!? I tried to shove it out of my mind, but I kept drifting back to him roughly running a hand over my crotch as he.. well I dunno what he&rsquo;d say. He probably wouldn&rsquo;t fuck me the way he does with Pete, maybe it&rsquo;d be some kind of hate-sex/punishment thing and holy shit why I am even <strong>thinking</strong> about this?! I groaned, weakly hitting my head against the pillow again. </p>
<p > Crickets chirped. </p>
<p > Fireflies glowed. </p>
<p > ....okay.. </p>
<p > Okay maybe.. it wasn&rsquo;t <em>so</em> wrong, y&rsquo;aknow? I&rsquo;ve imagined stuff like having sex with teachers before, it&rsquo;s not like I would actually <em>want</em> it or anything. It&rsquo;s just in my head, right? Pete won&rsquo;t ever know. &lsquo;Sides, if I get it outta my system now, that&rsquo;ll mean I won&rsquo;t do something fucked up later. </p>
<p > ..yeah actually, that was a good point.. I listened hard for a second, trying to hear whether Pete or the psycho were still awake. Didn&rsquo;t sound like it. Okay. </p>
<p > I swallowed hard and closed my eyes, pretending like I could hear the psycho walking up to me, saying&hellip; shit, what would he say? &lsquo;Oh, hell-<em>oh</em> moron. Hot &lsquo;n bothered for me, I see.&rsquo; </p>
<p > I shifted back. &lsquo;Fuck you,&rsquo; I pictured him standing in front of my chair, knife in hand and a smirk plastered on his smug face. He may be creepy-looking, but his face was always <em>utterly</em> punchable. Imaginary-psycho chuckled at that. </p>
<p > &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;d like that, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; Fake psycho straddled me, enough so that I could feel his body heat, but not actually touching, the little shit. I whined and tried to squeeze my legs together as hard as I could as   h  e kept talking. &lsquo;Ramming into me, hm?&rsquo; He chuckled at my struggling, the fucking <em>tease</em>! His voice fell to a sexy little purr. &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t even need to make sure I liked it&mdash;just fuck me as hard and long as you want.&rsquo; </p>
<p > I thought-growled, &lsquo;Yeah, because <em>that</em> isn&rsquo;t something you&rsquo;d do,&rsquo;   Hi  s smirk turned into a grin as he reached out to lightly brush his fingers over my chest&mdash;which was suddenly bare (hey, it was a fantasy) . </p>
<p > He replied slowly as he looked down. &lsquo;Oh, and you don&rsquo;t want to?&rsquo;   He   laughed when I felt the guilt burn in my gut, mixing with the anger and lust. &lsquo;Thought so. Face it, Jimmy-boy&mdash;you&rsquo;re just like me.&rsquo; </p>
<p > I frowned. Christ, even when I&rsquo;m making shit up he manages to be a fucking asshole. &lsquo;Yeah, bull<em>shit</em>. I&rsquo;d never do that to Pete.&rsquo; </p>
<p > He   quirked an eyebrow. &lsquo;Oh, but you&rsquo;d do it to <em>me</em>?&rsquo; I also imagined him brushing a hand over my crotch, moving his hand teasingly away when I thrusted into the heat. Asshole. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s kind of self-defeating, moron.&rsquo; </p>
<p > Fuck,   I kept it up for <em>hours</em>, imagining the psycho taunting and teasing me, bringing me right up to the edge with words and the lightest touches. By the time the sun came up I felt half-  crazy   from horniness and lack of sleep. It wasn&rsquo;t like I&rsquo;d stayed hard all that time, but I was on-edge enough that I was at half-mast when I heard movement from the bedroom. Shit! I closed my eyes and rolled my head back onto the pillow I&rsquo;d spent the night ignoring. Please don&rsquo;t be Pete, please don&rsquo;t be Pete, please don&rsquo;t be Pete.... He was careful to be as quiet as possible, which didn&rsquo;t tell me anything. Then I heard a dark chuckle as he passed me. &ldquo;Good morning, moron. Sleep well?&rdquo; </p>
<p > I didn&rsquo;t bother suppressing the shudder at hearing that voice in the flesh. I opened my eyes and started following the psycho&rsquo;s movement around the room <em>real</em> close as he snapped a light on and started going through a pile of papers. Man, I fucking hate him. How can such a fucking <em>monster</em> be so calm about what they do? He frowned as he read one of the papers and snacked on a bowl of cereal. That meant he kept getting sugar on his fingers&hellip; and licking it off. Fuck. Blood rushed south, and I licked my lips before whispering hoarsely, &ldquo;Hey. I&ndash;I gotta pee,&rdquo; He glanced up from his maps before sighing. </p>
<p > He got back up from the table he&rsquo;d sat down at like it was some huge effort, talking as he looked around for the kettle. &ldquo;You know moron, I&rsquo;m starting to think Petey gives you too much to drink,&rdquo; I straightened up and spread my legs as wide as I could. The psycho gave me a look that was probably supposed to make me feel like an idiot, &ldquo;I mean seriously, you go, like, seven times a day,&rdquo; He shook his head as he pulled the kettle out and started sauntering over to me. &ldquo;That seems just a <em>tad</em> excessive,&rdquo; He finally knelt, noticing my now-bulging erection. Shit, I was leaning forward now, straining against that stupid fucking tape&mdash;if I wasn&rsquo;t careful I was gonna make a puddle of drool the size of Canada. He rolled his eyes as he went to undo my jeans, and God help me I nearly moaned when I heard the zipper coming undone. Like a chorus of fuckin&rsquo; angels at this point. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s wrong with you, but it&rsquo;s probably some form of erectile dysfunction,&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t fucking care what he said I just wanted him to <em>keep undoing my pants</em>. Luckily, he didn&rsquo;t seem too weirded   ou  t, undoing the button on my pants without any protest before pulling my briefs down. But he did a double-take when he saw that the inside of my pants were already slick with precum. &ldquo;&hellip;what, did you have another acci&ndash;&rdquo; I interrupted him by thrusting in his direction. The psycho flinched back, looking up at me. I just stared at him; he&rsquo;s the one who loves reminding me how much smarter than me he is! He could probably already tell what I wanted  .   But the fucker just blinked at me! &ldquo;&hellip;Is that a yes?&rdquo; He looked a lot less disgusted than I&rsquo;d assumed he would be. But he wasn&rsquo;t <strong>doing</strong> anything! &ldquo;&hellip;Wait, wait&hellip; do you seriously want me to&ndash;&rdquo; Are you kidding me!? </p>
<p > I groaned, hissing, &ldquo;Come the fuck <em>on</em> psycho, I&rsquo;ve been listening to your moaning all <em>fucking</em> night!&rdquo; I tried to buck my hips again, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy with the duct tape on my legs. He looked so surprised that I growled, &ldquo;What, haven&rsquo;t &lsquo;seen this before&rsquo; or some shit?&rdquo; He shook his head slowly, switching from looking at my face to my now-throbbing dick. I automatically tried to reach down and just <em>drag</em> him closer, but I just ended up pulling on the handcuffs and duct-tape&mdash;I gave a frustrated cry, hissing, &ldquo;Come <em>on</em>, crazy! You want&rsquo;chya fuckin&rsquo; <em>slave</em> to see somethin&rsquo; like this?&rdquo; </p>
<p > The psycho&rsquo;s eyes narrowed at that. Flicking his eyes to the door, he muttered, &ldquo;Petey is <em>not</em> a slave.&rdquo; </p>
<p > I grinned; bingo. &ldquo;Pet, then.&rdquo; Haha <em>that</em> made &lsquo;im flinch. My mouth suddenly decided to chuck any reason I had left into a fire; pissing the psycho off sounded way more fun. I leaned back a little, cocking an eyebrow as I hissed, &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you two do last night? Doggy style?&rdquo; I made   my   voice all quiet as he stared at me with pure loathing. &ldquo;<em>Was he too tight to fuck</em>?&rdquo; Man the way his jaw tightened was fuckin&rsquo; beautiful. It was like a game; how long &lsquo;till he SNAPS? I grinned and added, &ldquo;Ooh, I&rsquo;ll <em>bet</em> he was&mdash;Pete&rsquo;s sooo obviously a virgin,&rdquo; I paused, shrugged. &ldquo;Well, was,&rdquo; He looked like he was actually going to explode by now, so I shifted so my head was as close to him as I could get, staring at him intently as I purred in my sexy voice, &ldquo;Ya know Gary&hellip; <em>I</em> wouldn&rsquo;t be too tight to fuck..&rdquo; And I made sure to twitch my dick when I said that. I lowered my voice again, staring at him even though I couldn&rsquo;t read his expression. &ldquo;You could fuck me <em>all</em>. <em>Night</em>. <em>Long</em>. And I bet I could make you come <em>way</em> faster than &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo;~&rdquo; I ran my tongue over my lips as I watched his fist clench and unclench, kettle totally forgotten. &ldquo;How long&rsquo;d it take last night, hm? Twenty, thirty minutes?&rdquo; Suddenly, he shot straight up and walked over to one of the cabinets. I laughed; finally! Let&rsquo;s see how <em>he</em> liked someone getting under his skin. &ldquo;Bet I could cut that to five! Three, if you let me fingerfuck ya,&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t answer, just walking straight back to me with something else in his hand. &ldquo;Hey, how long do you think it&rsquo;d take if I had to stay tied up? Hm?&rdquo; I grinned even as the schitzo ripped a piece of duct tape off the roll with a neutral expression. &ldquo;I could probably get you moaning my name in seven minutes! Ten, tops,&rdquo; He leaned down to slap the tape over my mouth, but I leaned back, avoiding his hand as I kept talking. &ldquo;Heh, you&rsquo;re so <em>loud</em>, I wonder what Pete&rsquo;d say w&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p > But then his fingers were wrapped around my throat, shoving my head back so I couldn&rsquo;t move. I couldn&rsquo;t think for a second for the sheer terror&mdash;I started thrashing around, but it didn&rsquo;t last for very long. By the time I was aware again the psycho had successfully slapped the tape over my mouth&mdash;annoying. But the worst part was when he tucked me back into my briefs and redid my pants. What the fuck!? </p>
<p > I thrashed around again as the psycho straightened up and dusted his hands off, the mother<em>fucker</em>! &ldquo;Wow, moron,&rdquo; He shook his head as I kept tugging at the restraints, desperate for <em>something</em> to show after <em>six fucking hours</em> of self-torture! &ldquo;I mean, <em>wow</em>! That&rsquo;s kind of amazing,&rdquo; He smirked even as I tried to set him on fire with my mind&mdash;he just turned away and sat back down at the table. &ldquo;In case you&rsquo;re counting, that&rsquo;s a grand total of <strong>two</strong> utterly failed escape attempts on your part!&rdquo; I froze at that. Shit, I hadn&rsquo;t even thought about that.... Finally looking back to his maps and frowning, the psycho added absently, &ldquo;And one hundred percent of them have somehow involved your penis,&rdquo; He snickered to himself and glanced back up at me, adding, &ldquo;Are you sure somebody didn&rsquo;t fill that cavity you call a head with a bunch of testicles?&rdquo; Then he went back to his maps without a fucking word, like nothing had even <em>happened</em>. </p>
<p > As the silence stretched on and I caught my breath, it dawned on me that I&rsquo;d just completely fucked myself over. In a way, I&rsquo;d kind of figured the schitzo wouldn&rsquo;t want me&hellip; the unhealthy obsession with Pete showed he was a one-man kinda guy. But I&rsquo;d expected the lunatic to at least be disgusted when he found out I wanted to fuck him, or pissed off, or.. I dunno use it to humiliate me or something. Instead, what I got was fuckin&rsquo; <em>nothing</em>!? Like I don&rsquo;t even matter? That <em>hurt</em>. More than I really felt like admitting. </p>
<p > When Pete got up and asked about the gag, the psycho said I was &lsquo;on time out&rsquo; and that I &lsquo;wasn&rsquo;t to be interacted with&rsquo;. Honestly, I thought that was for the best. I spent the rest of the day trying to avoid looking at anybody so they couldn&rsquo;t see I&rsquo;d been crying. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 8: Power Trip~  ~~~~~&lt;PoV: Pete&gt; </p>
<p  >As I focused on the pencil lines spinning out across the page, the rest of the world fell away&mdash;just me and the physical sensation of making something. But after a while, my concentration broke when he suddenly laid himself down across my lap. Crap, had I missed something? I did need to give a handjob today.... But he didn&rsquo;t seem annoyed or anything, content to just keep his head in   m  y lap. I let myself relax a little as he got comfortable&mdash;I could handle this. </p>
<p  >It&rsquo;d been a little more than three weeks by now, and I had gotten less terrified of the sex stuff. I don&rsquo;t like it, but it&rsquo;s not as bad, now that I know how he thinks a little better. Giving him a small smile to assure I wasn&rsquo;t going to push him away or anything, I went back to sketching for a while. I even managed to get re-absorbed in trying to draw the weird mental image I had of a sparrow with a mouth full of sharp teeth. It was the closest I was getting to relaxing these days. Gary&rsquo;d been getting.. I guess I would call it &lsquo;desperate&rsquo;, and his temper&rsquo;s gotten way shorter too, which was really weird after the utter confidence he&rsquo;d sported for the first couple of weeks&mdash;now he was snappish, constantly checking and double-checking things, sitting and staring blankly at the wall while he drummed the blunt end of his knife against his hand before abruptly grabbing a pen and scribbling something on one of his many maps. I think that means the loop is ending soon&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t seem like he&rsquo;d made it this far before, hence the lack of confidence. With the handjob exchange happening pretty much nightly by now, Gary had started&hellip; saying some stuff that had me worried. Stuff like &lsquo;God, you&rsquo;re beautiful&rsquo; or &lsquo;Please, Petey, I <em>need</em> you&rsquo;. Stuff that makes me think he wants more than just sex. That he wants me to.. love him, I guess? And I had no idea how I was going to pull that off. Gary suddenly piped up and snapped me out of my sketching bubble. &ldquo;You want to hear about the first time I kissed you?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Time to keep us alive. &ldquo;If you wanna tell me, I guess,&rdquo; As I talked I tossed the sketchbook onto the floor and leaned back against the wall. It&rsquo;s weird how after all this time, I do feel&hellip; close to Gary. I can&rsquo;t say I like him (romantically or otherwise), but there&rsquo;s a part of me that enjoys listening to all his random trivia and asides about zany adventures from time loops long ago. </p>
<p  >Gary&rsquo;s lips twitched in a faint smirk before he launched into his tale. &ldquo;We were sitting on the dock overlooking Bullworth harbor&mdash;we&rsquo;d bought some fish and chips and you laughed at something I&rsquo;d said and I just&hellip;&rdquo; He sighed, moving his hands to support himself so we were eye-to-eye (or at least a bit). I shuddered a little when he looked at me with an intense longing and sorrow when he said, &ldquo;&hellip;I just couldn&rsquo;t help myself, you know?&rdquo; Reaching his hand out as he continued talking quietly, he gently brushed a thumb down the side of my face, and I had to force myself to not flinch away. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so beautiful  ....  &rdquo; He paused for a moment before leaning forward suddenly, pressing his lips onto   mine  . It lasted longer than the casual pecks he springs on me in public, but I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have characterized it as &lsquo;making out&rsquo;&mdash;when he pulled away, I could hear the faint smirk in his voice. &ldquo;It was just like that; heh, you were so startled  ....  &rdquo; He trailed off again, just leaning his forehead against   mine   and trailing his other hand up and down my arm. </p>
<p  >Time slowed to a crawl. I swallowed and tried to both ignore the fact that Gary was staring at me while resisting the temptation to look <em>anywhere</em> but at him. Jesus this was always so awkward&hellip; &ldquo;So.. um, do you want me to&hellip; you know?&rdquo; He sighed, closing his eyes as he moved away&mdash;crap, his shoulders were slumped, that&rsquo;s usually a bad sign. &ldquo;Oh, sorry&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Shaking his head as he leaned back on his hands, saying softly, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Quirking an eyebrow, he added, &ldquo;I was actually hoping you&rsquo;d let me do something for you?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I gulped, automatically flicking my gaze to the door before snapping my eyes back. &ldquo;How badly do you wanna do that?&rdquo; Gary clearly noticed, since he turned his head in the direction of the door, thinking for a bit before he answered. </p>
<p  >Letting out a long breath, he said, &ldquo;I only want it if you do,&rdquo;   I breathed a sigh of relief at that.   T  hank God; Jimmy   wa  sn  &rsquo;  t on the line, at least. He turned back to me, saying lowly &ldquo;So do you?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shook my head. &ldquo;No, sorry&mdash;are you sure it&rsquo;s okay?&rdquo; Doing stuff <em>to</em> Gary is far more tolerable than the reverse. What he does feels good sometimes&hellip; hell, <em>really</em> good&hellip; but it&rsquo;s just&hellip; weird. I can imagine liking it, but the fact that I don&rsquo;t have a choice keeps me from fully enjoying the sensations. When it&rsquo;s me doing stuff to Gary it doesn&rsquo;t turn me on or anything, but at least it feels like it&rsquo;s my decision. </p>
<p  >He sighed at my response, muttering, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it&mdash;I figured as much....&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Almost a minute passed in silence before I said slowly, &ldquo;Uh, so what do you want me to do?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >To my surprise, his face turned a little pink as he talked. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve been thinking.... Since we&rsquo;re almost to the end of the loop and all, and this is the last day we&rsquo;ll be restocking supplies&hellip; maybe you could do something a little.. special?&rdquo; I actually had to chew on the inside of my cheek to keep from snickering at him looking <em>bashful</em>. He&rsquo;s usually such an asshole, it&rsquo;s kind of funny seeing him like that. </p>
<p  >Considering his words, I frowned a little. &ldquo;Uh, special.. how?&rdquo; If he said anything about butts, Jimmy would be paying for all my snacks for life. Assuming we get out of this. </p>
<p  >His nervous expression shifted to relief before he launched into his explanation. &ldquo;I was thinking maybe&hellip; well, you&rsquo;ve gotten a lot better at blowjobs&mdash;but, e  rm  ..&rdquo; He cleared his throat a little before continuing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been really good about not using teeth during them, you know?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I blinked as Gary bit his lip, checking to see if I understood what he was trying to tell me. &ldquo;Uh. Well yeah, you told me not to do that,&rdquo; I grimaced. &ldquo;Plus it really doesn&rsquo;t sound enjoyable..&rdquo; He let out a huff. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yeah, I.. suppose it might not. But&hellip;&rdquo; he rubbed the back of his neck, looking at the bedspread as he spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it and I would really, <em>really</em> appreciate it.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >His hooded expression implied that this was something he wanted <em>really</em> badly. Still, I cocked my head in confusion. &ldquo;You want me to <em>bite</em> your <em>dick</em>?&rdquo; What the hell? &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that super dangerous?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He shook his head, leaning forward and clasping his hands together. &ldquo;No, no, I just want you to scrape your teeth over it a little&mdash;not bite,&rdquo; He frowned, expression lost in thought before he added under his breath &ldquo;&hellip;not yet, anyway.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >There was another moment of silence as I honestly tried to wrap my head around this request before I said, &ldquo;But&hellip; why?&rdquo; Most of the things I had done with him were things I   could at least   see being pleasurable&mdash;somebody licking my penis <em>does</em> feel good, even if Gary&rsquo;s the only person who&rsquo;s ever done that, and I&rsquo;ve masturbated before, but this? Teeth plus penis did <em>not</em> sound pleasurable in the least to me. </p>
<p  >Gary held eye-contact for a few moments, before flicking his eyes away and giving it some thought. &ldquo;I like the idea of you being&hellip; eager. That you want me so badly you&rsquo;re rushing. If that makes sense,&rdquo; I frowned, considering that. </p>
<p  >I nodded slowly. &ldquo;Okay,   then  .&rdquo; I swallowed as I put it into practical terms, though. &ldquo;I can try? I, uh, don&rsquo;t know how to act like that, though.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Gary&rsquo;s uncertain expression had returned to being elated&mdash;or as elated as he ever looked. He shook his head, laughing a bit as he added, &ldquo;You <em>trying</em> is plenty, don&rsquo;t worry, Petey.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I nodded; it really does seem like I can&rsquo;t do anything wrong in terms of getting Gary off. Maybe after all this was over I&rsquo;d actually be able to get with somebody else and see how good I really am. &ldquo;Right, then.&rdquo; Licking my lips, I took a deep breath as I slowly moved closer to him. Eager&hellip; how would I act if I really <em>wanted</em> this? Hm&hellip; well, I only really have Gary as a metric for how people act when they have sex. And &lsquo;eager&rsquo; is certainly a good description of it, so maybe I should act like him? On that note, I reached out and grabbed the front of his shirt, pulling him forward a little suddenly. He had done that on occasion, though he usually apologized when I flinched at it. I started licking his lips the way he did with me, and moving my arms to wrap around his neck and stuff. Apparently that was good, because he started pulling me forward just as &lsquo;enthusiastically&rsquo;, and he was trembling a little. That&rsquo;s always a good sign. This time the kiss had lots of tongue; I frowned as I thought. Eager, eager&hellip; I tried turning my head to the side, sticking my tongue into the mouth as far as it could go&mdash;Gary moaned and tightened his grip on my shirt. Good; definitely good. He sucked on my lower lip for a little before gluing our mouths together again and desperately licking the roof of my mouth before pulling away. </p>
<p  >As we caught our breath, I adjusted my position so I was straddling him. I managed to keep from grimacing when I could feel he was getting hard <em>already</em>. &ldquo;Your lips are chapped, Femme Boy.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I blinked, pausing in tugging at the bottom of his shirt. &ldquo;Uhh&hellip; sorry?&rdquo; What was I even supposed to say to that? </p>
<p  >As Gary let me peel his t-shirt off he said, &ldquo;No&hellip; I kinda like it..&rdquo; When his face was clear of the shirt, he leaned in so he was next to my ear and whispered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a good reminder of how different you are&rdquo; before running a tongue over my neck. </p>
<p  >I really don&rsquo;t get the neck thing, but it&rsquo;s not unpleasant so I just asked, &ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;different&rsquo;?&rdquo; Gary didn&rsquo;t answer immediately, instead choosing to alternate between slower licks that covered a lot of area and tracing patterns with the tip of his tongue. I don&rsquo;t mind the pattern stuff so much, so I just closed my eyes and tried not to think too deeply about what was happening. </p>
<p  >Eventually he said quietly &ldquo;give me a hickey and maybe I&rsquo;ll tell you&rdquo; before moving back to kissing. He wanted a hickey? Isn&rsquo;t that more of a guy-on-girl thing normally? Oh well&mdash;I shrugged, waiting until there was a lull in sucking my tongue to move to the side of his face and start licking that. Gary suddenly balled my shirt in his fist and he sounded breathless when he said, &ldquo;We-well you&rsquo;re different in thaaat you&rsquo;ve been through more than most oth&mdash;MM yeeah harder ohh&hellip;&rdquo; I&rsquo;d started scraping my front teeth up and down his neck. Man, this was so weird; who would think that felt good? Either way the one thing I&rsquo;d learned over the two weeks of regular sexual contact was that you needed to do a bunch of different things to keep it interesting. Or at least that&rsquo;s the case with Gary; so I started flicking my tongue and moving under the chin. At least he seemed to like it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s, ah, little things you know? Like how <em>hmm</em> you lick your lips a loOot more than the Peteys I know doooohGOd~&rdquo; His speech then appeared to leave him entirely when I started nibbling and sucking on the other side of his throat. </p>
<p  >At first, I&rsquo;d assumed Gary would want me to suck him off and fuck me in the ass and what-not&mdash;I mean, he&rsquo;s called me &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo; since the start of the year. I figured he wanted to&hellip; I dunno, bully me more, I guess. But as we&rsquo;d kept doing this&hellip; sex stuff over the past couple weeks it&rsquo;s more like <em>I&rsquo;m</em> the one with power over him. In these moments, at least. It&rsquo;s kind of terrifying, having so much power over somebody&rsquo;s feelings. Sometimes I get this weird sense of vertigo; it&rsquo;s like&hellip; this one time my parents took me to Chicago and we&rsquo;d gone up into one of those skyscrapers with a deck with a clear floor. They actually had to drag me away because I&rsquo;d refused &lt;&gt;to move out of fear&mdash;but when they did carry me back to the regular floor, I&rsquo;d started crying at not being able to see the city in all its miniscule glory anymore. That&rsquo;s kind of how it feels with Gary&mdash;like being frozen in fear, but also out of awe of the sheer scale of it all. </p>
<p  >Plus, there&rsquo;s the sick thrill I get from having him in the palm of my hand despite all the horrible shit he&rsquo;s doing to us. </p>
<p  >Gary had quieted down a lot, so I pulled away and reached down to pull my own shirt off. Before I could, though, he grabbed my hand. &ldquo;Wait&mdash;don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed a hand down my shirt. &ldquo;I kind of like wearing less clothing than you.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Huh. I nodded in acceptance, running my hand over the bulge in his pants as I added, &ldquo;You mean less than you are now?&rdquo; he gasped when I did that before nodding vigorously; well, that wasn&rsquo;t very surprising. I took a deep breath, licking my lips nervously as I started undoing his jeans. Wiping the spit off with the back of my hand, I almost laughed at how un-grossed out I was by the idea of licking somebody else&rsquo;s genitals. I&rsquo;d only given a couple of blowjobs so far&mdash;he saves those for a &lsquo;special occasion&rsquo;&mdash;but it&rsquo;s gotten a little easier. The first one&hellip; that was the worst, since I&rsquo;d somehow managed to bottle up all the disgust for afterward so that it hit me in sickening waves. By the second I&rsquo;d actually learned to harness the numbness that I&rsquo;d felt that first night. I took a deep breath and let the quiet emptiness fill my head&mdash;Gary had swung off the bed to pull his pants fully off, and when he got back on the bed he was totally naked. He shifted his legs so they were kind of surrounding me, and as I stroked him I asked, &ldquo;Is that good?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He squeezed his eyes shut and groaned, &ldquo;Yeah, <em>harder</em>&rdquo; as he moved his hands from his sides to grasping me. Speeding up the stroking made him kind of curl into himself, like he was scared I&rsquo;d dissapear suddenly. Though I would if I could have. I fought the instinct to lean away&mdash;he does this all the time. Thumbing the head with my other hand made him start whining, looking up at me with a desperate expression on his face as he said, &ldquo;Petey, <em>please</em>, I need you!&rdquo; while shifting his hips into my hands. </p>
<p  >Mentally I added &lsquo;&ndash;to suck my dick&rsquo; to that sentence as I nodded, trying to get him to just calm down a little. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; But he shook his head as he tightened the grip he had on my shirt. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;No, no&hellip; please, just&hellip; <em>want</em> me&hellip; just a little?&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I should still be jerking him off when he was looking at me with such a vulnerable expression; felt kinda weird. Still, I nodded. He has this creepily-accurate ability to tell when I&rsquo;m faking an emotion. I frowned and tried to let myself &lsquo;want&rsquo; Gary. I thought back to that first blowjob&mdash;the rush of fear and triumph I&rsquo;d gotten from totally disobeying him. It was the first time I&rsquo;d intentionally denied Gary what he wanted, and it&rsquo;d felt <em>so good</em>. Tapping into that, I was kind of able to enjoy scooting back to dip my head down toward his crotch. Not like I had a choice anyway. That was kind of a liberating thought as I wrapped my lips around a rock-hard penis. At first, I just licked it a little, then I remembered what he had said earlier about teeth. Adjusting myself so I could better see his expression, I tried knocking my teeth against the shaft a little more than I would normally; Gary instantly sucked in a breath as he squeezed his eyes shut and hissed, &ldquo;HMM yeah just like THAT ohGod&rdquo; I had started scraping my teeth over it experimentally, and I was kind of surprised that he seemed to like it. Hm. I moved to the side, returning to just regular licking as he caught his breath before abruptly mock-biting it from that angle. That actually made him kind of thrust his hips, knocking me in the head with his thigh. &ldquo;holyJesus<em>fucking</em>hell!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I pulled back, absently commenting &ldquo;Geez&hellip;&rdquo; as I rubbed the side of my head. As I did so, I tried to stop shivering and slow my heartbeat. Jesus, this is always freaking terrifying! Gary reached out for me, but I waved his hand away as I forced myself to reach down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; To prove it, I resumed stroking. If I didn&rsquo;t just keep doing it, I knew I would feel even worse. As for Gary, it was almost like he was having some kind of episode he was shaking so much. That was&hellip; probably a good sign, at least. </p>
<p  >As I bent down and resumed licking, he said shakily, &ldquo;C-can you mmAybe try swallowing thisss time?&rdquo; That gave me pause&mdash;I grimaced as I pulled away. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Do I have to?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve already gotten semen on my face&mdash;I did <em>not</em> want any in my mouth. </p>
<p  >Gary let out a breath, squeezing his eyes shut when he turned away. After a few moments he sighed again, turning back to stare at me. &ldquo;Yeah. Yeah, you <em>do</em>.&rdquo; I shot my eyebrows up before twisting my face in disgust; was he <em>serious</em>!? We maintained eye-contact for a solid minute before I realized, yeah, he <em>was</em> serious. </p>
<p  >So much for being the one in control. I stared him straight in the eye. &ldquo;Do you mean &lsquo;torture Jimmy if I don&rsquo;t&rsquo; &lsquo;have to&rsquo;?&rdquo; I really, <em>really</em> did not want to do this. He nodded, his expression very blank. I closed my eyes. Oh my God this is my life now. I took a deep breath and exhaled sharply before saying as calmly as I could, &ldquo;Okay. Okay, <em>okay</em>, OKAY! Okay.&rdquo; I snapped my eyes back open and resumed stroking, sighing. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just get this over with.&rdquo; Good Lord this is my fucking life now. I slathered the flat of my tongue up and down the thing, making sure to scrape my teeth against the shaft as I did so, which made him moan. Because of course. </p>
<p  >I then wrapped my mouth around it, rubbing my tongue on the tip; that seemed to work since he started grabbing my head and hair. &ldquo;OhFUCKPeteyes<em>yesyeahohGod</em>&rdquo; For fuck&rsquo;s sake, he seriously <em>still</em> calls me &lsquo;Petey&rsquo; even during this shit? Whatever, not my problem&mdash;my problem is having to <em>swallow</em> somebody&rsquo;s <em>jizz</em>. Ugh. I focused on his face for a few moments; he was enjoying this. A <em>lot</em>. Fucker. I frowned, and started gnawing on the head. Who knew, maybe that&rsquo;d be too much and he would need to get penile restoration surgery or something. <em>That&rsquo;d</em> get him to stop. </p>
<p  >&hellip;That&rsquo;s not what happened. My mouth abruptly filled with a warm liquid; it was more startling than anything else since there wasn&rsquo;t much, but a sizable portion managed to get shot down my windpipe. I pushed away and started coughing, and later I was mad that I hadn&rsquo;t tried to aim for his face, but at the time I was more preoccupied with being able to breathe. I felt him sit up and grab me by the shoulders. &ldquo;Shit! Petey, are you okay!?&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t really able to reply, trying as I was to get air into my lungs. He ran his hand through his hair shakily, frantically whipping his head around the room as he muttered, &ldquo;oh God, oh God, shit, shit SHIT not <em>now</em>!&rdquo; Sheesh, he looked like he was about to start <em>crying</em> or something! </p>
<p  >Finally clearing my airway enough, I was able to squeak out, &ldquo;Hey, &lsquo;mokay, just&mdash;&rdquo; I paused to cough some more as Gary practically started hugging me in relief. &ldquo;&ndash;went down the wrong pipe.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He let out a breath, before removing his hands uncertainly, like he wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do now. Suddenly, a voice from the other room cut in. &ldquo;Hey Pete! Would&rsquo;jya say that was&hellip; <em>a lot to take in</em>!?&rdquo; I snorted, laughing and coughing harder than before, and I could hear Jimmy&rsquo;s voice through the door as he said, &ldquo;Yess! Jimmy Hopkins: Master comedian!&rdquo; Slipping off the bed, I made my way out of the room, shaking my head as I passed him to get to the sink. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Oh my God, Jimmy what is&ndash;&rdquo; I paused to hack up another lung as I filled a cup before continuing. &ldquo;&ndash;<em>wrong</em> with you!?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t have kept the grin off my face if I&rsquo;d tried. </p>
<p  >Jimmy, duct-taped to his usual chair, shrugged. &ldquo;Dunno. Guess I&rsquo;m just fuckin&rsquo; awesome, dude.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes as I swished the water around and spat it into the sink. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s more like you&rsquo;ve got a&hellip; <em>sex</em>th sense for these things?&rdquo; I grinned at Jimmy (who&rsquo;d begun snorting in laughter at that) as I set the glass back down and took a deep breath; seemed my airway was clear. Waving good-by I headed back into the room. I felt a little bad, knowing he could hear most of the stuff that happens. Luckily, he&rsquo;s smart enough to not comment. Well, usually. Gary&rsquo;d already curled up into a fetal-position when I shut the door&mdash;at least he&rsquo;d put his underpants back on. Letting myself flop on the bed, I realized the room smelled <em>really</em> gross. At least he didn&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;cuddle&rsquo; yet. I closed my eyes, trying to relax and go to sleep. But it takes me a lot longer to fall asleep nowadays, since my mind refuses to stop thinking about&hellip; anything. And it didn&rsquo;t help that he was <em>right there</em> and the sex smell was still in my nose. </p>
<p  >After a while, I started to notice something a little off&mdash;Gary usually waits until he thinks I&rsquo;m settled in before starting the spooning, but he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything now. Actually, he wasn&rsquo;t touching me at <em>all</em>. I looked over to see if he was alright, but all I could see was his breathing was a little faster than normal. Man&hellip; I really didn&rsquo;t want to set him off, but.. maybe he was upset about something? Pushing myself up onto my hands, I said softly, &ldquo;Uh, hey, you alright?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I couldn&rsquo;t see Gary&rsquo;s expression, but I heard the biting laugh just fine. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act like you <em>care</em>, Petey..&rdquo; He then added quietly and with a lot less venom, &ldquo;It makes everything else hurt more.&rdquo; I frowned. I kind of <em>have</em> to care if I want to make sure nothing went wrong. </p>
<p  >Maybe that was the wrong approach, though. Thinking for a bit, I commented lightly, &ldquo;Hey, you never finished your story&mdash;about the first time we kissed?&rdquo; I leaned back against the headboard for the bed, arms crossed as I tried to get comfortable. As weird and uncomfortable Gary&mdash;for lack of a better term&mdash;&lsquo;snuggling&rsquo; me is, I&rsquo;d rather he was happy than the alternative. Making him upset could be dangerous; he hadn&rsquo;t done anything to us yet, but I really did not want to take any chances. </p>
<p  >He sighed, his reply a little muffled by how his arms were still covering his head. &ldquo;I never talked about <em>that</em> story, Petey.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I blinked, furrowing my eyebrows in confusion. &ldquo;Uh, are you sure? The one about, uh, fish and chips?&rdquo; It may have just been my eyes fooling me, but it looked like he was a little less tense now. He sighed. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;That was when <em>I</em> kissed <em>you</em>. It&rsquo;s different.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;How is that different?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He snorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kidding, right?&rdquo; He rolled his head over so he was giving me a patronizing look. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <em>different</em> in that you <em>reciprocated</em>, Femme Boy.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I blinked as he stared at me for a few more seconds before turning away again. Reciprocated, huh? That was weird. &ldquo;&hellip;do you wanna tell me about that story instead? It sounds interesting,&rdquo; I guess if he&rsquo;d never done the kidnapping thing, it&rsquo;s not like there would&rsquo;ve been a reason not to be attracted to him. Maybe? Honestly I don&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;m gay or not anymore. </p>
<p  >He laughed a little at that, and the smirk was clear in his tone. &ldquo;Now Petey, don&rsquo;t <em>lie</em>! Don&rsquo;tchya know what happens to liars?&rdquo; The clipped way he said that with implied he&rsquo;d said that many times before&mdash;there&rsquo;re a few lines like that. </p>
<p  >I considered as I rested an elbow on my knee. &ldquo;Something painful? Or horrifying, maybe?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Gary snorted, adopting a weird monotone as he spoke. &ldquo;We kick &lsquo;em in the balls. Ha ha.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Frowning, I tried to remember the logic of how we&rsquo;d gotten to this point at all. &ldquo;Wait, why am I a liar?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He shot up suddenly, turning around and shooting me a glare as he crossed his arms across his chest. &ldquo;Come <em>on</em>, Petey,&rdquo; He increased the pitch of his voice to be more &lsquo;girly&rsquo; and said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Ooh, Gary, the story of the time you manipulated me into pity-dating you sounds <em>soooo</em> interesting!&rsquo;&rdquo; He glared for a bit more before turning back to lie down&mdash;I frowned when he did. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Uh, yeah that <em>does</em> sound really interesting. How was I lying?&rdquo; He groaned again, but didn&rsquo;t turn around this time. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just <em>that</em> it&rsquo;s your whole act that&rsquo;s a lie, okay?&rdquo; He snorted. &ldquo;I mean seriously, you&rsquo;re sucking up more than any Nerd I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; I froze&mdash;<em>shit shit shit!</em> But he just sighed morosely. &ldquo;Just shut up. Maybe tomorrow I&rsquo;ll be more in the mood to pretend that this whole web of lies I&rsquo;ve spun is real.&rdquo; Silence for a few seconds. </p>
<p  >I kicked my mind into high gear, trying to parse what was happening. Gary was upset with me for &lsquo;sucking up&rsquo;&mdash;maybe especially in contrast to how I&rsquo;d ditched him earlier? That made sense, at least; I didn&rsquo;t even think about it. </p>
<p  >And what about the &lsquo;web of lies&rsquo; comment? It seemed like he thought I was asking just because I wanted to stay on his good side. Well, that was pretty much the exact train of thought that&rsquo;d lead me to start this conversation in the first place. Still, though&hellip; I did genuinely want to know more about Gary. To make sure he couldn&rsquo;t hurt us, yeah, but Gary still&hellip; deserves to be known? I guess? </p>
<p  >I don&rsquo;t like the sex stuff but even I can tell that Gary&rsquo;s not evil&mdash;something&rsquo;s seriously wrong with him, but he&rsquo;s still a person with feelings and stuff. I kind of feel like I owe it to him to at least try and return some of that affection; and it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;d just forgotten about us being friends as kids. Getting to know him better was the only thing I could think of that I knew I genuinely wanted. </p>
<p  >I shifted so I was facing Gary&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;re right. Yeah, I was kinda playing teacher&rsquo;s pet a little. But I wasn&rsquo;t asking about you because I want to get on your good side!&rdquo; Replaying what I&rsquo;d just said in my head, I amended, &ldquo;I mean, not <em>just</em> because of that. I also want to get to know you as a person, you know?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Eventually Gary pushed himself up and adjusted himself so he was also cross-legged and facing me. I couldn&rsquo;t read his expression. &ldquo;And <em>why</em> should I believe that steaming pile of bullshit, Femme Boy?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I cocked my head, considering for a moment (and ignoring the &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo; in there) before saying slowly, &ldquo;Well&hellip; you did say something about me being, um, different. And I mean, yeah, I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> like the things you do. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I think you&rsquo;re evil or something.&rdquo; Gary kept his face completely blank, not saying anything for a few seconds. Eventually I let out a tired sigh. &ldquo;Look, optimism or not I still genuinely want to know you better.&rdquo; Cocking my head, I asked, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what you were saying earlier? That you want me to want you?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He scowled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean like <em>that</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shrugged. &ldquo;I dunno what to tell you, Gary&hellip; I mean, it&rsquo;s the most genuine I can be..&rdquo; He went quiet for a long moment. Sometimes Gary really looks both like he&rsquo;s a fourteen-year old kid who doesn&rsquo;t have the first clue about anything beyond his own arrogance and like he&rsquo;s as old as all the years he claims to have lived. </p>
<p  >It was like the teenager and the centuries-worth of memories were fighting for dominance. He eventually closed his eyes. &ldquo;Afterward, you basically worked your jaw like a dead fish for a few seconds before asking me like a billion questions,&rdquo; I nodded encouragingly when he cracked an eye open, assuring him that yes I really was listening, and yes I did think it was interesting. We talked for a while; I wasn&rsquo;t sure how long, but by the time we fell asleep Gary&rsquo;d managed to wrap himself around me in the usual cuddle-puddle. </p>
<p  >That night, I had a dream that I was drowning in a hot liquid, and when I woke up to Gary&rsquo;s weight pressed against my side I had to swallow the instinct to scream. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 9: Countdown ~~~~~~&lt;PoV: Gary&gt; </p>
<p><em> BWA bwa Wh </em><strong> a </strong><em> t&rsquo;s new pussycat? Whoa whoa whoa oh&ndash; </em> &ldquo;Fuck! I hate this song.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Hey, Hopkins, do you hear that? It&rsquo;s the sound of your fingers breaking if you don&rsquo;t shut&ndash;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Whaaat? I like this song! I mean, it&rsquo;s not as good as the version I&rsquo;m used to.... That one starts much better.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Whadya mean?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >My knuckles turned white on the steering wheel. &ldquo;Well, it starts with a buildup to&ndash;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I ground out, &ldquo;What part of &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll break your fingers if you don&rsquo;t shut the fuck up&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t you understand, shit-for-brains?&rdquo; Honestly, they&rsquo;re lucky I&rsquo;m even playing a CD, but that comment seemed to shut the old wives up. All I wanted to do was stop driving and stab something, preferably Jimmy, but even a small woodland animal or a tree would fucking do at this point. </p>
<p  >But no. We&rsquo;d almost reached my goal, so I had to get more miles between us and the last town. &ldquo;So.. um, Gary?&rdquo; I sighed. Here come the questions. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yes, Petey, I know where we&rsquo;re going. And no, I&rsquo;m not telling you where.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&hellip; Okay then..&rdquo; And he went back to staring forlornly out of the window like a kicked puppy. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;That time of the month?&rdquo; And fuck if I couldn&rsquo;t see Hopkins&rsquo; shit-eating glare in the rearview mirror. I saw Petey tense up, but screw it&mdash;I was NOT in the mood. </p>
<p  >I slammed on the breaks; nobody would come down this road anyway. I had to fumble to undo my seatbelt, by which time Petey had already gotten up somehow and was making his way to where Jimmy was. I finally extracted myself from my seat to see him pulling some duct-tape off the roll. What? I tried to sound aloof, but it probably came across more pissed than I&rsquo;d have liked. &ldquo;Femme Boy, what the fuck&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say anything, just slapped the tape over the moron&rsquo;s mouth despite his protests. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;See? It&rsquo;s fine. Nobody&rsquo;s fingers need to be broken, okay?&rdquo; I narrowed my eyes, but Petey gave me his best puppy-dog eyes. &ldquo;Please?&rdquo; In the background I could hear Tom Jones crooning <em>&hellip;I loooove you, yes I do&hellip; you and your pussycat eyes&hellip;</em> I ground my teeth, hating how weak I was acting, but time was wasting. After all that, I just turned around and buckled up again, bring the engine to life. Petey breathed a relieved, &ldquo;Thank you, Gary,&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t really want to hear that, but it made me feel a little better against my will. </p>
<p  >There were only five days left. <em>Five days.</em> I had gone three weeks without a reason to reset&mdash;nobody died, nobody ran away, nobody needed to go to the hospital, we didn&rsquo;t run into any cops, <em>nothing</em>. Why the hell was everything going so <strong>well</strong>!? It was like they weren&rsquo;t even <em>trying</em> to get away anymore! Except when balls-for-brains legitimately tried to <em>seduce</em> me into freeing him; that had been so pathetic it was almost <em>sad</em>. I sighed as I watched the dusty rocks of Arizona zip past the window. What do I fucking care? This was all going to end soon anyhow. In the rear-view mirror, they had started a game of Uno. Petey had to hold Jimmy&rsquo;s cards for him, and Jimmy pecked the one he wanted to play. I adjusted the mirror so I at least couldn&rsquo;t see him anymore, but the jealousy still burned in my gut. It was like by trying to build a fantasy that Petey and I were on a road trip that just happened to have a hostage, I ended up being some abusive parent that was dragging a couple of long-suffering siblings on a road trip. I took a breath and fixed my eyes on the road ahead of me, repeating the mantra that had gotten me through the last couple weeks under my breath. &ldquo;<sub>You can murder him next time, you can murder him next time, you can murder him next time&hellip;</sub>&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;So, uh, do you wanna play a game or something, Gary?&rdquo; I snapped my gaze back to the rear-view mirror, which I&rsquo;d focused on Petey. He was wearing his &lsquo;hopeful&rsquo;   expression. </p>
<p  >I went back to staring at the road and replied dully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m driving.&rdquo; I wanted to wallow in angst by myself for the next few hours. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yeah, but we can just talk,&rdquo; And God fucking damnit I just had to glance at him while he was playing <em>Jimmy&rsquo;s</em> fucking card, and the jealousy turned from a low simmer to a gout of flame. </p>
<p  >&ldquo; YEAH WELL MAYBE I DON  &rsquo;T WANNA FUCKING TALK!&rdquo; <em>murder him next time murder him next time murder him next time</em> I didn&rsquo;t see Petey&rsquo;s reaction to that because I&rsquo;d leaned forward to put the rear-view mirror out of my line-of-sight. Come <em>on</em>, genius, keep it together. Only five days to go, come ooon. I tried to calm down by pulling up one of my favorite Moron Murders. I let the memory of familiar actions unclench my jaw&mdash;the shocked betrayal-Whut-Wat written clear as day on the moron&rsquo;s face, the sound of cloth and skin being sliced, the warmth of the blood running down my arms. I let out a sigh, leaning back, feeling a bit calmer now. That really is a good one, especially if I can manage it without Petey there. </p>
<p  >Speak of the devil. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; just a bit quiet without the music&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have to talk if you don&rsquo;t want, I can just talk,&rdquo; I made the mistake of glancing back up at him, but he didn&rsquo;t look as scared as I&rsquo;d assumed he&rsquo;d be. Wait, what did he say? I noticed for the first time that the CD had run out, so there was no sound in the vehicle beyond the occasional bump in the road and cards being laid down. </p>
<p  >I shrugged, realized he wasn&rsquo;t looking at me, then added, &ldquo;Do what you want, Femme Boy,&rdquo; He glanced up and smiled a bit at that. And Lord help me it made it feel like it was worth it. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Okay. So, I was saying about &lsquo;What&rsquo;s New Pussycat&rsquo;, the version my parents and I like to listen to has a different beginning,&rdquo; He laid down a card. &ldquo;Instead of that stupid blast of drum, it starts off with this great piano chord....&rdquo; Petey continued blathering on, and even though I&rsquo;d stopped listening I still kept my eye on his face in the background. He looked.. maybe not <em>happy</em>, but relaxed. And he maintained eye-contact with me the whole time&mdash;it reminded me of the days before, when I took a stab at pretending to be a normal teenager, with friends and everything. It was&hellip; nice. Even if it wasn&rsquo;t real, I could pretend he wanted me here. The landscape continued speeding by as the sun lowered a bit in the sky and orange lights began winking on in front of every human structure. At some point, Petey even managed to get Jimmy&rsquo;s gag off on the sly, but the moron didn&rsquo;t seem to have much to contribute to Petey&rsquo;s seemingly inexhaustible list of the flaws of that Sonic game his parents got him for Christmas,   so I didn&rsquo;t bother making him put it back on. </p>
<p  >Eventually, of course, we reached our destination. I was a bit disappointed&mdash;having his voice wash over me like that was very relaxing. Oh well. &ldquo;Aaaand, gotta cut you off there, Petey. We&rsquo;  ve arrived,  &rdquo; I cut the engine as his next no doubt insightful gripe about hedgehog bestiality died at the prospect of being able to move around. Hell, I was happy about it, too. </p>
<p  >Jimmy groaned. &ldquo;&lsquo;Bout fuckin&rsquo; time, too, Christ. Where the fuck are we? Feel like we drove to goddamn Australia.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >The temptation to stab him had lessened considerably. In fact&hellip; I knew this next move wasn&rsquo;t going to net me the most favorable opinion on Petey&rsquo;s part, so perhaps I could throw Jimmy a bone for Femme Boy&rsquo;s sake. As I shifted the vehicle into reverse I replied dryly, &ldquo;I think I would have noticed if we had driven over the Pacific Ocean, moron,&rdquo; Cutting off the engine (and Jimmy&rsquo;s raspberry), I continued, &ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;re about twenty miles from the next nearest source of water,&rdquo; I could see them give each other their &lsquo;fuck, <em>now</em> what&rsquo; look in the rearview mirror as I unbuckled my belt and finally stood up. &ldquo;So, I wouldn&rsquo;t think about running <em>too</em> far, if I were you,&rdquo; Luckily the gravity of the situation didn&rsquo;t need explanation&mdash;their expressions told me as much. I began removing the chain with the keys to the handcuffs from around my neck, which made Jimmy perk up considerably. He tugged on his restraints, which made me smirk. I love seeing him helpless like this. I tossed the keys to Petey as I headed for the exit, which made him flinch so they clattered to the floor, naturally. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m letting you out. But keep in mind it&rsquo;s about four days to the nearest source of water, if you really book it,&rdquo; I just grinned wider when he scowled at this news. I continued cheerily, &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll be back in..&rdquo; I glanced at my watch, did a few quick sums, &ldquo;..thirty minutes. Don&rsquo;t have fun without me, &lsquo;kay? Byeeee!&rdquo; and with one last wave I was out of there. </p>
<p  >FINALLY! The desert air was dry as a bone and it was dusty as heck and the sun was low enough that it was stabbing me right in the eye socket, but at least I was outside. I finally allowed myself a moment to stretch, feeling my back give a satisfying series of clicks after sitting in the same position for so long. But, I couldn&rsquo;t stand around enjoying myself&mdash;starting down the path marked by a small mailbox I&rsquo;d parked next to, I chuckled to myself, cracking my knuckles and fingering the knife at my hip. I had a <em>dead</em>line to keep. </p>
<p> ~~~~~~Chapter : Down Time~~~~~~  </p>
<p  >While we were waiting for the psycho to get back, the sun slowly went down and an obnoxiously orange light flicked on next to the mailbox we&rsquo;d parked next to. And that whole argument we&rsquo;d had earlier about leaving the psycho had come up again. &ldquo;You have GOT to be SHITTING me, Pete! We need to get out of here, RIGHT NOW!&rdquo; I was trying <em>really hard</em> not to punch Pete in his stupid, perfect fucking face. </p>
<p  >But he just shook his head, arms crossed over his chest. &ldquo;We either leave with Gary, or we don&rsquo;t leave at all, Jimmy. No argument.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Fuck you!&rdquo; I punched the side of the RV &ldquo;OW! Motherfucker!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Pete did his &lsquo;explaining shit&rsquo; sigh before launching into his lecture thing. &ldquo;Look, I get it&mdash;but I really think Gary&rsquo;s losing it; just <em>stay patient</em>, and keep a lookout for a chance to immobilize him or something.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snorted. &ldquo;Jesus Pete, you forget about that <em>knife</em> hanging at his hip!? Because I fucking haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He groaned, slapping a hand to his face. &ldquo;I know, I know! I&rsquo;m <em>trying</em>, I just don&rsquo;t want anybody to get hurt, okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Well what about what <strong><em>I</em></strong> want? Maybe I <em>want</em> somebody to get what he fucking deserves!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Then fine! Try and hotwire this stupid truck thing that we don&rsquo;t have the keys for and go!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >That fucking <em>hurt</em>. &ldquo;Dude, y-you <strong>know</strong> I can&rsquo;t leave you!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >When I first met him, I&rsquo;d never have been able to picture Pete with such a fierce expression on his face. &ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t leave Gary, either.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Hey, I thought I said not to have fun without me!&rdquo; FUCK! I spun around, heart hammering in my chest to find the psycho back, and smirking harder than ever. He laughed at how I&rsquo;d jumped. &ldquo;Steady now, Jimmy-boy! No need to kill more of your brain cells with cortisol!&rdquo; I glared at him, hating that he fuckin&rsquo; <em>knew</em> I don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;cortisol&rsquo; means. &ldquo;Anyhow, we&rsquo;d better get a move on, it&rsquo;s getting dark, and I&rsquo;d rather not get lost in the middle of.. what?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >As he was talking, I&rsquo;d noticed a dark smear of stuff on his forehead that looked like&hellip; The psycho had noticed Pete looking at him. &ldquo;Uh you&rsquo;ve got some&hellip;&rdquo; before gesturing vaguely to his face. </p>
<p  >The psycho looked confused, but then he reached up and felt his hair and looked annoyed. He muttered, &ldquo;Shit, my hands must&rsquo;ve still been wet,&rdquo; then turned around to go into the trailer. &ldquo;Hang on, gimmie a sec&ndash;  &rdquo;   but I grabbed his arm. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What the fuck!? Is that <em>blood</em>  !?  &rdquo; I scanned the smear, pulling him closer to get a better look&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t look like it does in the movies, where it&rsquo;s all bright red. It actually looked kinda brown. But I could still see that it was in the shape of a hand. Then he tried to pull away, and I tightened my grip. It was kinda hard to look away from it; was it his blood? Or.. </p>
<p  >Out the corner of my eye, I saw him reach for his knife, and I automatically grabbed his other hand. Then a couple seconds later I met his eyes, and it suddenly clicked that I had him! I grinned, and shoved him down before trying to knee him in the balls. I guess he &lsquo;anticipated&rsquo; that or whatever, though, &lsquo;cause he had his legs squeezed together. &ldquo;Mother&ndash;&rdquo; then he shoved me off and rolled away, &ldquo;&ndash;FUCKer!&rdquo; I scrambled to my feet as he got up, knife in-hand, ready to stab. God<em>damnit</em> I had been SO FUCKING CLOSE! </p>
<p  >He hissed, &ldquo;Handcuffs, <em>now</em>,&rdquo; and I felt my blood reach fucking boiling point. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you <em>make</em> me, motherfucker!&rdquo; I was going to make this asshole <em>pay</em>, &lsquo;mercy&rsquo; be fucking damned! </p>
<p  >The psycho shot me a savage grin&mdash;guess he was as eager to beat me as I was him. &ldquo;That can certainly be arranged!&rdquo; But before we could do anything, Pete moved in between us. </p>
<p  >I couldn&rsquo;t see his face, but he sounded terrified, even though his voice stayed steady, &ldquo;Gary, what.. whose blood is that?&rdquo; Shit, I&rsquo;d forgot about that. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Some asshole that lives out here,&rdquo; He kept the knife trained on me while he talked, &ldquo;It was between agreeing to have sex with him for the next couple of days and just murdering him, so&hellip;&rdquo; He shrugged, and I felt my jaw drop in horror. Holy shit, he didn&rsquo;t even <em>care</em>? </p>
<p  >Fucking hypocrite. &ldquo;Sounds like a fair trade to <em>me</em>,&rdquo; that must&rsquo;ve really stung, since he flinched. Good. I started eying his knife&mdash;how was I gonna get that away from him? </p>
<p  >But he wasn&rsquo;t done. &ldquo;  Well, I  &rsquo;ll be sure to bring Petey along with me next time, Jimmy&mdash;&rdquo; I felt my mind go blank. &ldquo;..He&rsquo;d probably prefer him,&rdquo; he jerked his head toward Pete, but he kept his eyes on me the whole time, &ldquo;over my skinny ass any day!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >That was the last fucking straw&mdash;fuck Pete&rsquo;s bullshit nice attitude, fuck this game of goddamn cat and mouse, and <em>fuck</em> the psycho! &ldquo;YOU&rsquo;RE <em>FUCKING</em><strong> <em>DEAD</em>!</strong>&rdquo; </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p  >It took a while, but eventually Pete&rsquo;s breathing evened out. It&rsquo;s not that I wasn&rsquo;t tired, I just had something I needed to settle. I rolled off the bed and went into the living room&mdash;right where we&rsquo;d taped the psycho up. There wasn&rsquo;t a ton of light, but he looked like he was asleep. Too bad for him! </p>
<p  >I straddled him on his chair and yanked his head up by the hair. He let out a beautiful yell of pain that was muffled thanks to the duct tape, but I loved it anyway. I pulled his ear closer to me so I could whisper, &ldquo;Hey freak, let&rsquo;s have a little chat, huh?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I couldn&rsquo;t see his expression, but I thought I heard a muffled sigh. I reached over and fumbled for a light, squinting when it clicked on. &ldquo;Ow..&rdquo; I rubbed one eye, but kept the other trained on the psycho. He didn&rsquo;t look intimidated at all&mdash;of fuckin&rsquo; course. &ldquo;So let&rsquo;s get some shit straight&mdash;if it were up to me, I&rsquo;da just beat the shit outta you and left you for dead,&rdquo; He raised one eyebrow and I could practically hear his fucking know-it-all response. &ldquo;<em>But</em>..&rdquo; I sighed, glancing over at the bedroom, &ldquo;..that&rsquo;s not what Pete wants.&rdquo; I shifted a little and got close to him again. &ldquo;Listen up, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m only gonna say all this shit once,&rdquo; then he fucking <em>laughed</em>, and I stopped to grab his hair to force his head closer to mine. &ldquo;Is this fucking FUNNY to you, psycho!?&rdquo; The fucker <em>shrugged</em>! I was grinding my teeth now in frustration&mdash;it was like he didn&rsquo;t even <strong>care</strong>! &ldquo;Fine. Let&rsquo;s see if you think <em>this</em> is funny,&rdquo; I let go of his hair and pushed his head against the back of the chair. Then I waited until he made eye-contact with me before I started choking him. </p>
<p  >He didn&rsquo;t react for the first few seconds that I could see. Then I felt him swallow, and he started blinking a bunch. Was this what it felt like when he&rsquo;d choked me? I could feel his pulse pound faster and faster. His eyes started darting around, especially toward the kitchen&mdash;almost like he was panicking. Good. As the seconds ticked by, he started squeezing his eyes shut and his fidgeting turned into this weird twitching. </p>
<p  >Whatever it was, it meant the leg I was straddling pressed up into my crotch and I realize I was, like, really fucking hard. I moaned and shifted so my dick was pressed right against his leg and damn that felt so good.... By now he was quieting down a lot, though, so I let go of his throat. He gasped, and I felt every muscle in his body tense as he sucked air in through his nose. His head fell to the side as he recovered. Fuck,I had to go to sleep&mdash;masturbating to thoughts of the psycho is one thing, but this was crazy. </p>
<p  >I started to get off, but then I remembered I was gonna say something. &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; He popped his eyes open and raised one eyebrow, and I could just hear him testily asking &lsquo;<em>what</em>, moron?&rsquo; &ldquo;You lay one <em>finger</em> on him, and I will personally rip you a new fucking asshole; GOT it?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He rolled his eyes and nodded. I yanked his hair up again and he hissed in pain as I asked through clenched teeth, &ldquo;<em>GOT it!?</em>&rdquo; This time he just nodded. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; I dropped his head, wiping the jizz stain off with the back of my hand before I got off him. &ldquo;Sleep tight, crazy.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He just muttered something into the tape I didn&rsquo;t catch; who cares&mdash;I was tired as fuck, and we had a long day tomorrow. </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p  >The next few days passed by in a blur. It felt like i&rsquo;d only just drifted off when the sound of sirens woke me up&mdash;soon the local &lt;&lt;and then I fell down a rabbit hole of researching new mexico&mdash;they&rsquo;re in Harding County, and the sherrif&rsquo;s office is in nearby Roy: <a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Roy-New-Mexico.html"><span style="color: black;">http://www.city-data.com/city/Roy-New-Mexico.html </a> oh, and also there&rsquo;s this really long article about the current sherrif from like a year ago: <a href="https://www.krqe.com/news/investigations/new-mexico-sheriff-convicted-of-cattle-country-crime_2018030506111985/1009221110"><span style="color: black;">https://www.krqe.com/news/investigations/new-mexico-sheriff-convicted-of-cattle-country-crime_2018030506111985/1009221110 </a> &gt;&gt; police force had arrived,which was a relief, espescially when They offered to take Jimmy and me in a separate quad car. Jimmy fell asleep while we were in the car, and while I was trying to go to sleep myself I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I heard a conversation about fences being cut orif I dreampt it. Then we were in a motel, and I finally got to sleep again until suddenly, it was morning. I&rsquo;d got used to waking up early, though. Instead I spent the morninng with Officer Garcia as his partner went and got some breakfast. &ldquo;Too bad Lonita&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t open early duding the week.&rdquo; But his partner came back with enough jerkey to make my stomach stop rumbling, so I certinly wasn&rsquo;t complaining. They mostly talked to each other, which I was both greatful for and annoued bythey werent asking about it , but that meant I was the inly one to blame when I ended uo thinking about it. </p>
<p  >While I was gnawing on a stick of peperoni&rdquo;, I spontaniously asked &ldquo;So where did they take Gary?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >The officers looked surprised by my question, but Garcia answered &ldquo;I&rsquo;d reckon Mosquero&mdash;that&rsquo;s where the county sheriff&rsquo;s office is.&rdquo; So he was getting locked up&mdash;good. I nodded and went back to working over my strip of meat. </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p > After jimmy woke up we went over to the magistrate office to be asked a bunch of questions.where are you from, when were you born, that jind of thing. Then &ldquo;When were you first approached by your kiddnapper?&rdquo; </p>
<p > I swallowed. &ldquo;Um, I don&rsquo;t remember exactly?&rdquo; </p>
<p > Garcia nodded, giving me an understandinng nod, &ldquo;whatever you think you remember is fine&mdash;just do your best.&rdquo; </p>
<p > I tried to pull up the moment again. &ldquo;Um, he didn&rsquo;t pproach me? I was walking by an alley un New Coventry&mdash;that&rsquo;s, um, a kinda bad beighborhood in Bullworth&mdash;when somebody just suddenly appeared and grabbed me. I didn&rsquo;t realize it was gary until we were in the carC you know? Anyway, I, um, all I know is that Jimmy&rsquo;d left me a note in my loccer ealrier in the day telling me to come meet him for something.&rdquo; I snorted. &ldquo;Figures the inly time somebody would want to hang out with me was to kiddnap me.&rdquo; I cleared my throat, &ldquo;Anyway, i&rsquo;d got out of my last class for the day, so it must&rsquo;ve been around 3:30?&rdquo; I started &ldquo;oh, and I went to my dorrm room to drop off my backpack&mdash;so maybe 3:30,3:40?&rdquo; </p>
<p > They nodded as they scribbled notes&gt;&lt;&gt;. &ldquo;Alright. You said in your nine one one call that Gary had kiddnapped youand your friend, as well as killed somebody. Did he say why he did those things?&rdquo; </p>
<p > &ldquo;Um.. well I think the reason he killed that man was because he was a pedophile? Well, not really&mdash;I mean, he said something about it beig more convine t to kill him than, uh, have sex with him.&rdquo; I frowned, shuddering as I saw gary &lsquo;s face sneared with blood from kast night. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t really think twice about that, I don&rsquo;t think&rdquo; </p>
<p > &ldquo;And the kiddnapping?&rdquo; </p>
<p > &ldquo;Um. Well he kiddnapped me because he, uh, loves me? Kind of? And he beeded Jimmy there to threaten me into doing what he wnted.&rdquo; </p>
<p > &ldquo;And he maintained this behavior for the entire month youMve been missing?&rdquo; </p>
<p>I nodded. &ldquo;I mean he&rsquo;s started acting a little different as the loop is ending..&rdquo; </p>
</div>


<p ><u> ~~~~~~Chapter : ~ </u> ~~~~~~&lt;PoV: Pete&gt; </p>
<p  >I couldn't sleep. Yeah, Mom and Dad are in this room and Jimmy's here too, but Gary is still just in the next room over. After an hour of lying still with my eyes closed, I decided to give up and go to the bathroom or something. On my way back across the suite floor from the bathroom, though, I saw Gary sitting in a chair looking out the window. Naturally, he was already staring at me by the time I noticed him. He smiled in what was probably supposed to be a friendly way before turning to the window. &ldquo;You know, originally I had wanted to do stuff with you as we traveled? Museums, amusement parks, road trip stuff?&rdquo;  </p>
<p  >I didn't trust myself to respond, and Gary didn't continue, so we just sat for a while. I could tell he kept glancing my way by the prickling on my skin, but I ignored it as best I could. I was just starting to feel a little sleepy again when I felt something cold on my neck. I flinched away, shooting Gary what was probably a really pathetic glare as he pulled his hand back. I was still trying to get used to not having to give in. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; The smirk didn&rsquo;t make him seem that sorry. &ldquo;Not gonna see you for another seven months after this, after all,&rdquo; He sighed, leaning back in his chair as he stared at me. &ldquo;Plus, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll get an outcome this good for a while..&rdquo; He ran a hand through my hair, and at first I forced myself to stay still out of habit, but then I rolled away from him. He pretended not to notice. &ldquo;&hellip;so I want to savor it as much as I can.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes at that. &ldquo;If you like me that much, why not just be my friend like a normal person?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He returned my eye-roll with one of his own. &ldquo;What, you think I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> try that? I did that for about seventy years. And I tried the dating thing for a few dozen decades before it became clear it wasn&rsquo;t going to work,&rdquo; I scrutinized him as he resumed staring at me, now with added angst. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;You know, I still don&rsquo;t get it; why go through all this?&rdquo; He quirked an eyebrow, and I elaborated, &ldquo;Just.. I mean, I guess it&rsquo;s like why are you doing <em>this</em>?&rdquo; I waved a hand between the two of us. &ldquo;Why not, I dunno, learn a language, or invent something or travel?&rdquo; I sighed, crossing my arms as I leaned back and looked out the window. &ldquo;I dunno. It&rsquo;s just a kind of boring way to use your power, I guess?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >That wasn&rsquo;t the right word, but Gary interrupted my search for a better one with a laugh. &ldquo;Boring? Really?&rdquo; He sighed, saying cheerily &ldquo;Been a long time since somebody called me &lsquo;boring&rsquo;!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I frowned to myself, saying, &ldquo;Not&hellip; boring. I guess, more like a waste?&rdquo; a cat darted across the street. &ldquo;It just seems like you could use this&hellip; ability? Curse? For something so much more useful than, well, raping me,&rdquo; I shrugged, looking at him directly. He was frowning thoughtfully, which was better than I expected. I thought back to the questions I&rsquo;d asked myself during sleepless nights in the last month. &ldquo;I mean, if it were me I&rsquo;d try and do something with all that knowledge, you know?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Gary shook his head and chuckled. &ldquo;Such a Femme Boy thing to want,&rdquo;.  </p>
<p  >I felt my lip curl up as I whispered to myself &ldquo;Well ex<em>cuse</em> me for trying to do something fucking productive.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >But Gary responded anyway. &ldquo;That was a compliment, Petey!&rdquo; Laughing, he added, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re literally the best person I know,&rdquo; He waved a hand, adding, &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s not just the love talking; I&rsquo;ve never met anybody as&hellip; good as you. Hell, you&rsquo;re the only person that I think could actually   follow through on those good intentions!&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what to make of the praise, so I just shrugged and rubbed the back of my neck. </p>
<p  >But then I heard Gary get out of his chair, and I automatically got up&mdash;only to get dragged forward before I could react. I was still so used to letting him get close, I didn&rsquo;t try and get away as he hissed in my ear &ldquo;But you know Petey, all that falls away eventually&rdquo; I finally snapped out of it, trying to pull away only for him to snake an arm around my waist. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just you, and nobody else there to watch,&rdquo; he pressed his face against mine and I stopped struggling. &ldquo;What would you do after ten years? A hundred? A thousand?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I could hear my heart beating fast, but I was used to the fear by now&mdash;since I wasn&rsquo;t physically able to escape, the next best thing was probably to just play along. Shakily, I responded, &ldquo;I, um&hellip; I dunno&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Gary sighed dramatically like he does when he expected a better response from one of his questions. &ldquo;Well in my case, I realized that there was no hiding what I was,&rdquo; he lowered his voice to a whisper as his lips were moving closer and closer to mine, &ldquo;So I stopped trying to pretend that I was anything other than a monster,&rdquo; He tried to kiss me but I kept my teeth clenched firmly together so he didn&rsquo;t get far. </p>
<p  >He sighed when I turned my head away, shoving me so that I fell into the chair I&rsquo;d been sitting in earlier. While I was disoriented he climbed on top of me and added in an undertone, &ldquo;Deciding to play the villian is a lot more fun than falling into the role by rote, anyway,&rdquo; I oriented myself just in time for him to dip his head to lap at my neck. Natch. </p>
<p  >I pushed him away. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a monster, Gary.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He snorted and shook his head. To my annoyance he made no move to get the heck off me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you know what the fuck you&rsquo;re talking about, Femme Boy.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I felt the boiling feeling start to well up on my legs where Gary was touching me, so I tried to worm away from him a bit. &ldquo;Whatever, just get off me! I-I&rsquo;ll yell if I have to!&rdquo; That gave him pause. We maintained eye contact for a few moments before he shrugged and got off. &ldquo;You know Jimmy calls you a monster, too,&rdquo; Gary quirked an eyebrow but looked curious enough that I continued, &ldquo;You both make it sound like you&rsquo;re.. always going to do the stuff you do, I guess. Like there&rsquo;s no way to change it. I dunno, it&rsquo;s like neither of you think there&rsquo;s a solution,&rdquo; I rested my chin on my hand as I glared at the cat darting across the street back into the darkness as I muttered, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s stupid is what it is.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >There was more quiet as I waited for the creepy burning to die down until Gary piped up again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss you so much tomorrow,&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t feel like responding to him. In fact, I was getting weirded out now, so I just got up and started heading for the bedroom. I wasn&rsquo;t shocked when Gary said, &ldquo;Wait, please&hellip;&rdquo; I sighed, but stopped and turned so I could hear what he said anyway. But I kept my body angled away from him. &ldquo;Can&hellip; can I just sleep in your room? Not with you, just&hellip; in the room.&rdquo; I tried to scan his expression, but by now I was too tired to really want to think about it too hard. </p>
<p  >I waved a hand as I moved back into the room. &ldquo;Whatever, Gary,&rdquo; I definitely heard him scramble to get up a few moments later, but I ignored it in favor of flopping back onto the pile of blankets we&rsquo;d dumped on the floor to serve as my bed. I felt kinda bad about it since Jimmy was fine to share the bed or even let me have it, but I seriously didn&rsquo;t want to make him sleep on any more uncomfortable surfaces. And&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t want to sleep with anybody. No prizes for guessing why. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Thank you, Pete,&rdquo; I grunted as I pulled the blanket over my head, trying to clear my mind enough to fall asleep. It took a long time. Gary&rsquo;s breathing evened out long before I drifted off myself. </p>
<p  >~~~ </p>
<p  >Flahsing lights and sirens pulled up outside the house and we walked down the front steps with our hands behind our heads. I didn&rsquo;t see what the point was, but Jimmy was adament about it. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fuckin&rsquo; trust a cop, Pete,&rdquo; which seemed a little excessive to me, but oh well. Nothing bad happened and they were pretty nice, so maybe it worked. When they saw we weren&rsquo;t trying to run or hurt them, they asked us where &lsquo;the hostile&rsquo; was and had us talk to another pair of cops that had pulled up a little after them as they went into the house. </p>
<p  >One scaned his flashlight up and down our bodies &ldquo;You boys alright? Anything broken?&rdquo; while the other spoke into the walkee-talkie thing in the car. </p>
<p  >Since Jimmy just stood with his arms folded stubbornly refusing to talk, I answered for him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re fine, I think.. oh, except Jimmy&rsquo;s been sitting a lot&mdash;so, uh, yeah?..&rdquo; Luckily he didn&rsquo;t comment on my awkwardness, just turning to his partner to tlak about something.  </p>
<p  >&nbsp;a month of only interacting with two other people. </p>




<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 1: Not Alone~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I took a deep breath, instantly recognizing the stench of good old Bullworth that indicated I was back. But I didn&rsquo;t get out of bed just yet. That had been such an unprecedented experience, I doubt I&rsquo;ll be able to perfectly recreate it no matter how hard I try. Of course it all made sense&mdash;Jimmy wanting to tear my spleen out and feed it to me, Petey being his typical, pacifist self. All par for the course. But it was the specifics that were&hellip; odd. Like, sure; he hadn&rsquo;t wanted to leave me to starve in the desert. That made sense in a Femme Boy logic kinda way. But there had been something&hellip; unnerving about him, still. I couldn&rsquo;t quite put my finger on it, but it was like he understood me. &lt;&gt;Perhaps our little chit-chat had unnerved me, or maybe it was how he&rsquo;d done his best to completely ignore me throughout the days we were at police stations and his parents were taking us under their wing at a local hotel before flying home. </p>
<p  >The moron, too, had acted strangely. Not out of character, exactly, but in a way that I hadn&rsquo;t quite seen anywhere else. He&rsquo;d never really hit on me directly unless it was in a very casual way. Not to mention the control Petey had over him! That was unprecedented, too. It was a subtle form of control&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think he even realized Jimmy was so under his thumb. The moron had been willing to follow all Petey&rsquo;s instructions no matter how they contradicted what he <em>really</em> wanted to do, like beat my head in. The fact that he hadn&rsquo;t was quite impressive. </p>
<p  >I let out a huff. I hated to say it, but I was giving Jimmy Hopkins far too much thought. Time to get going&mdash;that scenario wasn&rsquo;t going to repeat by itself, after all. I rolled out of bed, threw on my usual uniform and made it out of the room way before Petey&rsquo;s precious NPR started playing. First things first, I needed to get a couple of the law enforcement officers at work in this town fired. I&rsquo;m only a teenager with a kitchen knife after all&mdash;there&rsquo;s only so much memorization of patterns will do when a professionally trained law enforcement officer begins shooting to kill after they see you murder two of their colleagues. As I headed downstairs, I considered the timing; there&rsquo;s a window coming up where Jimmy goes into the main building and I can leave without ever having to see him, which is handy&mdash;being a stranger seems to give me extra intimidation points. So I weaved in and out of the same interactions I&rsquo;d seen countless times; a Bully hassles one of the Nerds, who apologizes, causing the blonde to back off and turn around, giving the Nerd the opening he needs to nail him with itching powder. I side-stepped blondie as he ran up the stairs without even thinking; completely normal. It also meant I had about two more minutes before I could leave without being seen by Jim-jam. </p>
<p  >Stopping at the water fountain, though, I heard something odd&mdash;from outside, it sounded like there was a fight going on. Jimmy&rsquo;s is always the first fight of the day; and he wouldn&rsquo;t be done with Crabblesnitch for another few minutes. Frowning, I was about to go over and open the door to see for myself what was happening when I realized the shouting had been mostly silenced&mdash;in its place, a far more quiet chorus of groans of pain. </p>
<p  >I only had the time to look around the hallway and take note of the fact that nobody else was noticing the rewriting of a fundamental law of the universe before a BANG interrupted my thoughts. I whipped my head back around to see one of the doors to the dorm swinging shut. </p>
<p  >And, more importantly, the moron was the one who had shoved his way through. Jimmy&rsquo;s butt-ugly brown jacket was torn and bloodied, and his jeans and shirt both looked like somebody&rsquo;d rubbed them into a pile of dirt. Even so, he was hardly slowed as he marched with purpose into the building. </p>
<p  >Then, his piggy eyes found me&mdash;he stopped dead in his tracks, and for a few moments, we both stood looking at one another dumbly&mdash;it felt like my brain had reverted to auto-pilot. </p>
<p  >The moment didn&rsquo;t last long, though. His what-whut-duh expression quickly morphed into his Murder face. He dropped into a bull-charge stance that I managed to dodge, but he grabbed my shirt as I was passing and threw me off balance. I tried to escape his grip, but to no avail&mdash;he&rsquo;d already managed to pin me. </p>
<p  >While my face was being beaten in, I realized that he was screaming at me. More than that, he was screaming a question&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t tell through all the pain and the blood running down my face. Raising my arms to shove him off, Jimmy managed to grab my hand. He stood suddenly, pulling my arm taught&mdash;at which point he brought it down on his knee, and the  <strong> CRACK </strong>  was even more sickening because I could <em>feel</em> it as the sound reverberated through my bones. </p>
<p  >At that point, it was too much; I had to compartmentalize. I squeezed my eyes shut, forcing myself to focus on the break&mdash;I could use that as an anchor. By tuning everything but the grinding pain out, I could get to that same zone of concentration that I need for escaping the police in a high-speed car chase. </p>
<p  >Snapping my eyes open, I was finally able to take stock and understand what was going on. My face was pressed in the floor, there was a ring of people around us chanting, and Jimmy was screaming in my ear, keeping me pinned with a knee in the small of my back. I focused on how he was pinning me&mdash;if I could just find a weak point.... Finally, my patience paid off. Jimmy shifted his weight to lean closer&mdash;no doubt to scream more obscenities&mdash;which meant I might be able to swing my legs to dislodge him. I tried it, and to my surprise it worked! Hopkins lost his balance and I successfully rolled away. </p>
<p  >Better able to take stock, I switched from flight to fight, itching to give the moron double the pain I&rsquo;d gotten. He was recovering from my escape fast, but a kick to the face sent his head flying back&mdash;seeing an opportunity, I pinned him, making sure to plant my legs on his arms so he couldn&rsquo;t shove me off. Then, I wrapped my good hand around his throat and <em>squeezed</em>  . Man, was  <em> that </em>  ever a good feeling! Jimmy&rsquo;s struggling got more and more frantic as the seconds trickled by, his yelling reduced to choked gasps. I cackled; I hadn&rsquo;t had this much fun with Jimmy in at least a few decades, I&rsquo;d been so wrapped up in the Petey project. His struggling had started to lose its steam, pulse hammering like crazy in my hand. God that was satisfying, knowing all the friendly moments with Petey meant <em>nothing</em>! I could end this idiot&rsquo;s existence whenever I wanted, and he couldn&rsquo;t do a fucking thing about it! &ldquo;<em>I WIN, MORON!</em>&rdquo; His eyes narrowed at that, but he was so far gone I just laughed. </p>
<p  >At that point, I was incredibly surprised when somebody tackled me bodily, throwing me off of Hopkins&rsquo; body and letting him gasp like a dying fish. &ldquo;Holy crap, Jimmy are you okay?&rdquo; There was a chorus of disappointed groans at what appeared to be the end of the fight, and the crowd dispersed as the first-period bell rang across campus. Whoever had tackled me must&rsquo;ve moved away very quickly because he didn&rsquo;t seem to be beating the shit out of me. Which tends to be what you expect somebody to do when they tackle you. &ldquo;  Jesus  &hellip; you guys could&rsquo;ve  <em> killed </em>  each other!&rdquo; It was Femme Boy; I know that voice better than any other, and it was Petey. </p>
<p  >Propping myself up on my good arm, I staggered to my feet, using my working hand to pin down the broken one so it wouldn&rsquo;t swing around so much. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s so bad about that, Femme Boy.&rdquo; I shook my head&mdash;the adrenalin rush that had come on with the broken arm had begun to ebb, and I was losing the clarity that came with it. </p>
<p  >Jimmy&rsquo;s coughing, meanwhile, had slowed to a manageable rate and he was attempting to get back on his feet despite Petey&rsquo;s cries of protest. Glaring at me, he made to move forward, growling &ldquo;  Answer me, asshole  &mdash;what did you do!?&rdquo; But Petey kept getting in the way, preventing him from moving forward. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Jimmy, hold on  &mdash;&rdquo;   Jimmy seemed to be trying to side-step Petey without shoving him, which was&hellip; odd. Jimmy was perfectly willing to shove him around when I asked during the early loop plans that required it. </p>
<p  >Either way his patience with Petey&rsquo;s maneuvering tactic wore thin almost immediately. &ldquo;Pete what the fuck are you doing!?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey held his hands up in a clear &lsquo;surrender&rsquo; gesture. &ldquo;I get what you&rsquo;re trying to do, but just hold off, all right? We need Gary, okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >That comment seemed to be the straw that broke the moron&rsquo;s back. &ldquo;We <em>need</em> him!?&rdquo; Petey was shoved to the side before he snatched my broken arm, shaking it around in a way that made me let out an involuntary scream of pain. &ldquo;We need fucking <em>Gary Smith</em> like a crack head needs fucking HEROINE, Pete!&rdquo; He dropped it before I could even move my good arm, continuing his tirade. &ldquo;This psycho&rsquo;s the fucking REASON we&rsquo;re here, damnit!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I backed away from Jimmy quickly, chuckling darkly. &ldquo;If it were up to <em>me</em>, I wouldn&rsquo;t have even fucking seen you today, moron,&rdquo; Jimmy snapped his gaze in my direction at my comment, but Petey either didn&rsquo;t hear or ignored it. Could&rsquo;ve been anything, since nothing was going according to any kind of scenario I&rsquo;d ever seen. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;But if that&rsquo;s true, then don&rsquo;t we need him even more?&rdquo; Femme Boy&rsquo;s pleading refocused Hopkins&rsquo; attention yet again. &ldquo;If he&hellip; caused this, somehow, he&rsquo;ll be able to fix it, too, right?&rdquo; A crumb of understanding seemed to spring up in those piggy eyes, and he began to look between Petey and me uncertainly. </p>
<p  >Meanwhile, I fought the urge to whip my head back and forth trying to stare at Petey and Jimmy at the same time and instead focused on a grey stain on the wall in the shape of a monkey. Or it may have been an octopus. I never could tell. But it was far easier to answer that question than to try and figure out whatever the <em>fuck</em> was going on in front of me. Petey&rsquo;s voice managed to cut through the whirlwind of thought, though, like it always does. &ldquo;Hey, Gary? Are you&hellip; okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Now, to be fair, his tone was very different from how he normally says it. Usually it sounds like he&rsquo;s just asking about my health; now he said it like I&rsquo;m wild animal that he doesn&rsquo;t want to piss off. But it was a small buoy of normalcy in this sudden ocean of weird shit. The laughter that bubbled up from some depths of my psyche felt horribly unnatural, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop. My whole body started shaking as I felt tears prick my eyes, and eventually I had to sit down to keep myself from falling over. Eventually the laughter died down and I was able to I take a deep breath before getting back to my feet and giving the best &lsquo;  apologetic  &rsquo; smile I could muster as I wiped my eyes. &ldquo;Sorry about that, small mental breakdown.&rdquo; Dropping the smile and moving back a bit, I decided to address the elephant in the room. &ldquo;Why are you two acting so&hellip; out of character today?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >It seemed like my little breakdown had made Hopkins a tad less violently aggressive, since he wasn&rsquo;t trying to murder me at that very instant. But he clearly wasn&rsquo;t happy as he rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Hm gee I go to sleep in a hotel room in fuckin&rsquo; New Mexico and when I wake up I&rsquo;m somehow in my step dad&rsquo;s car driving to Bullworth, maybe <em>you</em> should tell me why I&rsquo;m acting weird today, psycho!&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t respond, just stared at Jimmy. Of <em>course</em> he wasn&rsquo;t in New Mexico, what the fuck kind of question <em>was</em> that? </p>
<p  >Petey cleared his throat after a few seconds and added &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m kind of confused too, Gary&hellip; how <em>did</em> you get us back to Bullworth?&rdquo; I blinked. A part of my brain could tell I was doing the same thing that Petey does when I first tell him I want to have sex with him&mdash;the same whut-wat-duh expression that Jimmy&rsquo;s so enamored with. But another, much larger part of my brain did not give a single shit. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;You remember the last loop.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t a question. I was surprised that something gigantic didn&rsquo;t happen due to my revaluation&mdash;I would have expected a hole in the floor to open up and swallow me into the depths of hell, or for reality to suddenly melt away and leave me in a blank void, or to feel my insides begin to liquefy. </p>
<p  >None of that happened. All that happened was that Femme Boy just looked even <em>more</em> scared and confused. &ldquo;Uh.. I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean, Gary. Remember what?&rdquo; I scanned him up and down&mdash;he was the same as he always is, but there was a <em>very</em> subtle difference in how he carried himself. He was scared all right, but he wasn&rsquo;t <em>cowering</em> like beginning-loop Petey usually does. </p>
<p  >Re-establishing eye-contact with him, I figured he wouldn&rsquo;t get what had happened unless I spelled it out for him, like I fucking always do. &ldquo;You <em>remember</em> the fact that I raped you and tortured your friend, Peter,&rdquo; He did the standard two-second blink-to-process-statement, but after that he snorted in a kind of laugh. Seriously!? </p>
<p  >Hopkins wasn&rsquo;t so inclined to humor, thank God. &ldquo;How the fuck could we fucking <em>forget</em> that!?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Well you never remembered <strong>before</strong>, did you Jimmy!?&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t even talking to anybody at that point. They fucking KNEW, they REMEMBERED. What the FUCK. I needed to get away, <em>now</em>. Whatever they said was lost as I thought about what to do. <em>What do I do what do I do whatdoidowhatdoIFUCKINGDO</em>&mdash; </p>
<p  >Jimmy sudden shove made me automatically reach for my knife, before I realized I didn&rsquo;t have it. Wait&mdash;the knife! That was it! I had to reset, this fucking insanity simply couldn&rsquo;t be allowed to stand. I nodded to myself as I set a course for the kitchens. I flinched when I heard Petey call for me to wait up, but I ignored him. As I was pushing the door open, I also heard Jimmy running behind me&mdash;stepping outside, I waited until the last second before dodging left and letting him go careening down the stairs. Hopping over him as he lost his balance, I continued, focusing on how to give Hopkins the slip rather than the incoming mental breakdown. Sure enough, as a prefect was rounding the corner, I heard him running at me again. This time, though, I stopped dead and let myself get tacked. With the perfect keeping Jimmy occupied, I was finally able to make my way to the kitchen unmolested by all but my own fear. It filled my normally-active mind with a mantra of <em>they know they know they know they know they know they know they know </em>whywhywhywhyWHYWHYWHY </p>
<p  >I vaulted through the window of the kitchen with my good arm, ignoring the lunch lady&rsquo;s surprised cry. I grabbed the pot of boiling water on the stove and tossed it in her direction. She wouldn&rsquo;t get hit, but she&rsquo;d be distracted enough to not notice me grab the knife and hop back out the window. As I landed on the other side, I paused. They wouldn&rsquo;t give me much time, but I didn&rsquo;t need much anyway. </p>
<p  >Lifting the knife to my neck, I squeezed my eyes shut. No matter how many times I do this, it never really gets any easier. One quick slash later and the customary pain flared up along with the frighteningly powerful gush of blood. At least the worst of it was over&mdash;I staggered back a bit, my hand automatically coming up to stupidly grasp at the gash on my neck I&rsquo;d<em> just made</em>. I opened my eyes, already feeling the light-headedness of blood loss, and was surprised to find the cook looking genuienly concerned to find a student bleeding to death in her cafeteria. I tried to say something about Bullworth staff careing about their students, but my vision was already clouding over and I was pretty sure I&rsquo;d cut some vocal chords anyway. Besides, I was more concerned with the cold that was seeping into my entire body. At some point my back had hit the outer wall of the kitchen, or maybe it was the floor. The whole room was spinning like crazy. I couldn&rsquo;t stop shivering, and my eyelids were suddenly so heavy&hellip; I sore I could hear Petey calling my name, and I tried to respond&hellip; but then everything disappeared. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~ Chapter   2  : Wait why is this a separate chapter~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I flinched as Jimmy shouted at Gary &ldquo;Come on, psycho, how&rsquo;d you fuckin&rsquo; do it!?&rdquo; and shoved him so he staggered to his left. But Gary seemed to come to his own internal conclusion as he suddenly nodded to himself, turned on his heel and strode down the hall. Jimmy turned, with a deeply offended look on his face. &ldquo;That asshole ignored me!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes; it didn&rsquo;t seem like he had even heard&mdash;but we had to talk to him, I didn&rsquo;t have the first <em>clue</em> of what was going on! &ldquo;Gary, wait, we need to talk, please! Come back&mdash;  aaaand he  &rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; Sigh. Jimmy sped off, clearly intending to tackle him to the ground. I shrugged; crude, but effective, I guess. I jogged at a bit of a slower pace after. </p>
<p  >But when I opened the door out of the dorms, Jimmy was picking himself up from the foot of the stairs as Gary strode right along down the path toward the rest of the school. My gut twisted in dread; shit, he clearly had a destination in mind&mdash;and I had a hunch that it wouldn&rsquo;t end well for us when he got there. I sped up, jogging down the steps as Jimmy tackled Gary with a &ldquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s just <em>talk</em>, psy  &mdash;&rdquo;   But a prefect had chosen that opportune moment to round the corner. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Stop right there!&rdquo; I froze, and it seemed like Jimmy did too, since when I turned to look back at him, Gary had already ducked around the prefect as he was sprinting toward Jimmy. </p>
<p  >Crap! I automatically took a step in Gary&rsquo;s direction, but turned back to Jimmy when I heard the sounds of fighting. I know he&rsquo;s good at fighting but&hellip; &ldquo;You gonna be okay?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t answer, but a few seconds after I asked the prefect started howling in pain, and Jimmy just shoved him aside and ran up to me. I breathed in relief a bit before turning to look for Gary. </p>
<p  >&hellip;at which point I realized I had no idea where he&rsquo;d gone. &ldquo;Well, where&rsquo;d he go?&rdquo; Crap, crap, crap! I could feel my face scrunch up as I began thinking as hard as I could. Okay, okay&hellip; he was clearly upset earlier, he must be looking for a weapon&hellip; Jimmy interrupted with &ldquo;Sometime today would be fuckin&rsquo; nice, Pete!&rdquo; His voice had an edge to it&mdash;he was glancing back as the prefect recovered from his kick to the nards. I shook my head: come <em>on</em>, Kowalski, Jimmy&rsquo;s counting on you! Screwing my eyes shut I resumed my earlier train of thought. Okay, if he was looking for a weapon&hellip; probably the school&hellip; his knife! </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Shit, the cafeteria!&rdquo; I started sprinting as best I could, but I&rsquo;m not that fast and I wasn&rsquo;t even wearing shoes. Luckily, I could hear Jimmy hot on my heels. He took off ahead of me as I made my way up the steps, and a horrible thought struck me. Shit what&rsquo;re we gonna do if he&rsquo;s already got it? I&rsquo;m no fighter, and Jimmy may be tough, but Gary had <em>literally been killing him earlier</em>! But I shoved the door to the school open anyway&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t have time to come up with a better plan&mdash;or <em>any</em> plan, really. I could see Jimmy skid into the cafeteria as I entered the school lobby. Everybody not already in class&mdash;mostly Greasers and Bullies, by the look of things&mdash;stared at me as I ran across the school lobby barefoot and in my PJs. It might&rsquo;ve actually have been kinda funny if there wasn&rsquo;t a psychotic murderer in the building. A couple of seconds after I entered the cafeteria I smacked into somebody; luckily it was Jimmy. Geez, was I out of breath already? My panting made the apology a bit choppy. &ldquo;Sorry&hellip; what&rsquo;s&hellip; wrong&hellip;  ?  &rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t answer. </p>
<p  >Following his gaze, I finally noticed the big knot of people clustered by the wall separating the kitchen from the cafeteria proper, all of whom were being screamed at by the lunch lady to get out of there. I frowned as I caught sight of her face&mdash;she was&hellip;<em> upset</em>. Her face was pale, and her normal devil-may-care casualness was gone as she was trying to get the crowd to disperse. That was odd; she&rsquo;s usually so unflappable. I glanced over at Jimmy as I straightened up, still trying to catch my breath. He could tell too&mdash;<em>something is </em>Wrong. I broke eye contact to jog over to the crowd, trying to see what was going on. After a few minutes of fruitless jostling and trying to avoid having my feet get trampled, I was about to give up when somebody grabbed my upper arm and yanked me up onto the top of the salad bar thing. I was relieved to see it was Jimmy, but the stricken look on his face brought my mood right back down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gary all right.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I followed his gaze, confused about the weird tone he&rsquo;d used&hellip; and saw Gary, slumped by the wall with his neck sliced open. &ldquo;&hellip;Oh.&rdquo; For a few seconds I couldn&rsquo;t move, like my body was forcing me to absorb the horrible image. People moved in and out of my line-of-sight, but not enough to fully cover up the still-oozing circle of red&mdash;Holy<em> shit</em> that&rsquo;s a lot of blood&hellip; At least his eyes weren&rsquo;t open, I guess? Maybe that would&rsquo;ve been even creepier. He didn&rsquo;t exactly look like he was asleep either, since his mouth was hanging open in a kinda dead-fish way that I doubt he would&rsquo;ve approved of had he been a&hellip; aliv&hellip; aware. </p>
<p  >I was finally able to break my gaze away to find Jimmy, but I didn&rsquo;t see him in the immediate vicinity. Other teachers and authority figures had started threatening to give people detention should they stick around, so the crowd was finally dispersing. I finally spotted him over by the stairwell, retching into a trash can. I patted him on the back, unable to get the image of the huge pool of blood slowly creeping across the floor out of my head. When Jimmy finally finished, he leaned against the wall and crossed his arms protectively over his abdomen. &ldquo;I thought&hellip; I thought he was gonna kill <em>us</em>, what the <em>fuck</em> man&hellip;&rdquo; I nodded automatically, leaning on the wall next to him. The PA came on and announced that class was canceled for the day, and we were quickly scuttled into the stream of whispering students before everybody was shunted out of the school altogether. We just kinda stood off to the side and watched the world go past; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; </p>
<p  >&nbsp;The only clear thought in my head was gratitude that there was somebody else who could understand why this was important, even if I didn&rsquo;t even really understand how I felt myself. </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p  >&lt;section incomplete&gt;  </p>
<p  >Everything was so&hellip; normal. They roped the cafeteria off for a few hours, so they got a catering company to bring food to the dorms for dinner and breakfast while the police investigated, but other than that&hellip; it was just&hellip; business as usual. We went back to class a couple days later, and I had forty math problems for homework by lunch. I looked around after getting my food&mdash;nobody was looking my way or anything, and I couldn&rsquo;t see Jimmy at any of the tables that they&rsquo;d set up in the school lobby&hellip; so I sat down at an empty table. I ate my food mindlessly, just watching the other kids in the room walking around, laughing, eating. A couple of bullies walked past my table, chatting before one glanced at me and grinned cruelly. He snickered before turning to his friend and saying something&mdash;they both laughed and started walking over to me. To my surprise, instead of the usual fear&hellip; I was just <em>annoyed</em>. The one with his hair slicked back off his forehead despite the acne leaned on the table while his friend crossed his arms and provided backup. They were both grinning as the first one said &ldquo;Hey, man! How &lsquo;ya doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I was honestly just annoyed that they were talking to me&mdash;didn&rsquo;t they have anything better to do than bother me when I just wanted to be alone? &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; I resumed eating, pointedly looking away from the other kid, but I still heard him reply. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Fine, huh? That&rsquo;s cool, man!&rdquo; His other friend, the one with the black eye, nodded in agreement behind him. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yeah, totally. But&hellip; now that your boyfriend&rsquo;s dead&hellip; we gotta talk about you payin&rsquo; us to not beat on you.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t process what he&rsquo;d said for a few seconds. When I did, it was like my stomach abruptly dropped a few feet; like when you&rsquo;re in an elevator and it just suddenly drops and for a second you feel like you&rsquo;re going to die. </p>
<p  >I felt the grip I had on my fork tighten. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not my boyfriend.&rdquo; My skin felt weirdly warm all of a sudden; the one with the black eye frowned. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Sure, whatever.&rdquo; He shrugged, and added &ldquo;Point is he&rsquo;s not around anymore.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >His friend nodded, leaning closer as he tried to look threatening, saying &ldquo;So what&rsquo;re you gonna do, pipsqueak?&rdquo; I flicked my gaze between the two of them, surprised at how unafraid I was of the menacing looks they were giving me. What could they do that was worse than what had been happening for the past month? </p>
<p  >Even so, all three of us started when somebody said &ldquo;Hey! You guys got a problem or something?&rdquo; They turned around to find Jimmy standing with his arms crossed and a glare on his face. I grimaced; Crap, I didn&rsquo;t want Jimmy getting in trouble for me! </p>
<p  >I started to say something, but the one with the black eye said &ldquo;Shut up, new kid!&rdquo; He got all up in Jimmy&rsquo;s face, hissing &ldquo;Just &lsquo;cos you beat up a bunch of us yesterday doesn&rsquo;t mean <em>nothing</em>, &lsquo;kay?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy snorted, shoving the kid back as he said &ldquo;Just shut the fuck up, Tom.&rdquo; Turning to the other kid, he grabbed him by the scruff of his shirt and hauled him off the bench, growling &ldquo;You fuckers mess with Pete, you mess with <em>me</em>, got it?&rdquo; I scanned the nearby area for teachers automatically, hoping that they wouldn&rsquo;t catch Jimmy in the act&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t usually so blatantly violent during school hours&hellip; </p>
<p  >&lsquo;Course, it wasn&rsquo;t like things had been exactly normal lately. The one Jimmy had grabbed shoved him off, whining &ldquo;What the <em>hell</em> man? Jesus, we just wanted to mess with him a little bit&mdash;didn&rsquo;t know he was your boy-toy or anything.&rdquo; My whole body tensed suddenly, and before I could think about it I&rsquo;d thrown my plate at him. Unfortunately, the sandwich I&rsquo;d been trying and failing to eat earlier just fell apart and scattered around, not producing the satisfying <strong>SPLAT</strong> I had been hoping for. He just sort of flinched before turning to look at me in surprise. </p>
<p  >I glared at him for a few moments before he was abruptly whacked on the back of his head. &ldquo;OW! What the hell!?&rdquo; He started backing away, looking between us before Jimmy grabbed his arm and twisted it so he was pinned to the table at a very awkward angle. </p>
<p  >With his other hand, he reached out and grabbed the other one&mdash;I had completely forgotten about him. Jimmy was <em>snarling</em> now, and even I flinched a little at his tone. &ldquo;You call him that <strong>ever again</strong> and I will rip your fucking GUTS out, <em>got</em> it, Troy? Tom?&rdquo; He glared at both of them for confirmation, which he got in the form of a fearful nod. &ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He threw them away, adding &ldquo;Now get outta my sight before you make me barf all over my lunch&rdquo; before sitting heavily at the table I was sitting at, sighing as the other two scrambled to get away. The aggression in his expression drained away to reveal a mix of confusion, relief, and terror. </p>
<p  >After a moment, I said quietly &ldquo;You&hellip; you didn&rsquo;t have to&mdash;&rdquo; But Jimmy was already shaking his head. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&lsquo;Course I had to, Pete. You <em>know</em> I had to.&rdquo; I smiled a little&mdash;he was right; in a way, I&rsquo;d kind of been protecting him this last month, so I certainly understood the need to protect the people you love. We were quiet for a few more moments, just listening to the utterly pedestrian sounds of laughter and misery typically found in high schools all across the country. Then he added quietly &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s really like it was; I mean, I&rsquo;m not the best student or anything, but I <em>know</em> that there was a day early in the year where the teacher went on a random tangent about 1927 and baseball&hellip;&rdquo; I nodded. Nobody had found it odd that Galloway had given an assignment <em>exactly</em> like one from earlier in the year. My thoughts about this time loop thing and Gary and the blood had all been swirling around in my head yesterday, when the entire school shut down and the police had been asking an endless stream of questions when all I&rsquo;d really wanted to do was go find Mom and Dad. I didn&rsquo;t even want to ask Jimmy about his mom&mdash;from Jimmy&rsquo;s reaction to finding out she had canceled her cruise and been staying in Bullworth with my family while they were looking for us, it was way more affection than she showed normally. And, well&hellip; he clearly had a lot of, erm, feelings about his family. Finally, Jimmy said quietly &ldquo;So&hellip; what do we do?&rdquo; as he looked at me. </p>
<p  >I blinked. &ldquo;W-well don&rsquo;t look at me! I dunno <em>what</em> to do&hellip;&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t even noticed when I put my hands in my lap, but I squeezed my palms together as I looked down now. It helped. A little. &ldquo;I&hellip; I thought we were going to have to deal with getting Gary arrested and stuff, not <em>this</em>&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Sorry man&mdash;didn&rsquo;t mean to put ya on the spot like that.&rdquo; I sighed and returned to looking at Jimmy&rsquo;s face as he smiled apologetically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just always the smart one with the plan, ya know?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I smiled back, but said &ldquo;Come on, Jimmy, you&rsquo;re smart too!&rdquo; Jimmy snorted and looked at me incredulously. &ldquo;You are! I&rsquo;m serious!&rdquo; He was laughing a bit now. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, Pete, ya gotta know you&rsquo;re the smart one. If it&rsquo;d been up to me Gary probably would&rsquo;ve murdered me like five times!&rdquo; I flinched before shaking my head, annoyed with myself. It&rsquo;s just a <em>name</em>, sheesh! Jimmy frowned, saying &ldquo;Uh, sorry&mdash;&rdquo; but I waved a hand as I rested my elbows on the table. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, don&rsquo;t worry about it&rdquo; I frowned, muttering to myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just being dumb.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy cocked his head to the side, saying &ldquo;Huh? What&rsquo;d you say?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shook my head; I didn&rsquo;t want to talk about it. &ldquo;Nothing, forget it.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t look like he was just going to drop it, though, so I quickly changed the subject. &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve got Art next!&rdquo; Forcing a smile on my face, I added &ldquo;Looking forward to that, at least.&rdquo; Jimmy nodded, but his next line got cut off by the sound of the bell signaling the end of lunch. He had Math next, so we parted ways at the stairs. I kept my head down as a couple of people who were obviously law-enforcement walked past me to get to the headmaster&rsquo;s office&mdash;they&rsquo;d been asking everybody a lot of general questions about Gary and the events of yesterday. Did they know Jimmy fought with him? Or that all three of us talked? Or that we tailed him after he left the dorms? I pushed the door to the Art room open, wondering if I even <em>wanted</em> them to know. If they asked, how could I possibly explain anything without seeming like I was insane? Taking a deep breath as I pulled out my sketchbook (which had suddenly become almost like new), I put it at the back of my mind for now. I just wanted to get back to living my life without having Gary hanging over it every second of the day. </p>
<p  >So I did&hellip; for about a half hour. I was in the middle of doing the still life the class was supposed to depict (a watch, a bowl of Christmas ornaments, and a small sculpture&mdash;we were practicing for detailed objects) when the PA system came on. &ldquo;Would the students Peter Kowalski and James Hopkins please report to the front desk as promptly as possible, please and thank you.&rdquo; I froze, looking up from my work at Ms. Philips. She frowned in sympathy, grabbing the classroom hall pass and coming up to me. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Here you are, Peter&mdash;don&rsquo;t worry about your assignment, I&rsquo;ll put you down for full marks.&rdquo; I tried to smile back, but I just&hellip; couldn&rsquo;t. I nodded, heading out the door. Crap&hellip; what was I going to do!? What did they even know about him? And they wanted to talk to Jimmy too&hellip; how was I gonna deal with that? I tried to think of a plan as I made my way to the front desk, but planning isn&rsquo;t really my strong suit. Unlike somebody <em>else</em>. I scowled to myself when I entered the office; man, this was just <em>stupid</em> getting so worked up about&hellip; nothing! </p>
<p  >The secretary didn&rsquo;t even glance at me, so I just sat down. Squeezing my eyes shut, I did decide on one thing&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t be getting the truth, that&rsquo;s for sure. But what should I tell them? I couldn&rsquo;t just not talk, that would look super suspicious. A few minutes contemplation later, Jimmy skidded into the office, panting. &ldquo;Shit! Pete, ya okay?&rdquo; That made the secretary stop her typing. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Really, boy! Language!&rdquo; She then did a double-take, and added as she got up &ldquo;Excuse me, aren&rsquo;t you the new boy? Why have you not reported to Dr. Crabblesnitch yet?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy was looking at her like she was completely bonkers. &ldquo;Wh&hellip; um, I&rsquo;ve been <em>kinda busy</em>?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >She scoffed, adding &ldquo;Please, the good doctor has been <em>so</em> overworked! The police have been <em>quite</em> demanding. Speaking of which where is the other boy who&rsquo;s supposed to be here?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I stood up, adding &ldquo;Yeah, I know, I&rsquo;m invisible or something.&rdquo; Only the best for Bullworth students. I was surprised by somebody suddenly hugging me. &ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >It turned out to be Jimmy. &ldquo;Hey, I can see ya fine, Pete!&rdquo; He then proceeded to give me a noogie. I began pushing him away, but I was laughing&mdash;which seemed to have been his goal anyhow. I finally escaped Jimmy&rsquo;s grasp when a third person walked in. Clearly law-enforcement, but this person had more of a&hellip; watchful air about them than the people in uniform that&rsquo;d been so prevalent throughout the school. Jimmy started watching the guy pretty closely as he stepped away from me and shoved his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;Heya.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >The person blinked, but smiled and said &ldquo;Good morning. Ah, you two must be Jimmy and Petey, correct?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I automatically said &ldquo;Uh, it&rsquo;s Pete?&rdquo; I swallowed, adding &ldquo;not&hellip; um, not Petey.&rdquo; Well, at least they hadn&rsquo;t said &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo;. I felt kind of weird, with what happened at lunch I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I might do if I lost control. That would be <em>really</em> bad with a police officer. </p>
<p  >The guy simply nodded. &ldquo;Certianly, Pete. Anyway, I&rsquo;m Detective Willis with the New Haven Police Department.&rdquo; He held up a hand, adding &ldquo;Not to worry! You boys aren&rsquo;t in any trouble, I just need to talk with you about the&hellip; events of yesterday.&rdquo; She then turned to the secretary, saying &ldquo;Is there a place where we can speak privately?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >What&rsquo;s-her-name looked surprised before frowning, saying &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to speak in here, officer.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >The detective shook her head. &ldquo;I have to respect Jimmy and Pete&rsquo;s privacy. Is there an empty classroom, or?&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy piped up, saying &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a doorway to the roof or something right over there.&rdquo; He pointed at the wall where, I guess, this room was. He continued &ldquo;We could sit in there, I guess.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >She nodded and started heading toward the door. &ldquo;If you boys are alright sitting on the floor, that is!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy shrugged as I pulled up next to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in less comfortable positions lately.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snickered, adding &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we all?&rdquo; I think he wasn&rsquo;t sure whether or not I meant that in a dirty way, since he gave me a really odd look until we entered the auditorium balcony. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Ah, looks like we can sit.&rdquo; She smiled as we all sat down. She sat on the back of a chair as she pulled out a notebook. &ldquo;Now, I just need to ask you two a couple of questions. If you&rsquo;re not comfortable answering any, feel free not to answer. But this conversation might cover some touchy ground.&rdquo; She looked at me more than Jimmy during that spiel. Guess they&rsquo;d figured out <em>some</em>thing. &ldquo;Shall we get started?&rdquo;  </p>
<p  >I nodded, but Jimmy said &ldquo;Depends on what you&rsquo;re askin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Her eyebrows shot up at that. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Well, my first question is this; from our preliminary investigations, it seems you were the last people to talk with Gary before he died. Is that correct?&rdquo; Crap, here we go. I nodded, and when Jimmy didn&rsquo;t do anything, I nudged him pointedly. I kind of had an idea of what to say&hellip; mixing the truth and fiction, maybe; just so long as Jimmy played along. He nodded after I elbowed him. &ldquo;Right. And what did you talk about?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Deep breaths, Pete. I rubbed my arm with a hand and said quietly &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna talk about it.&rdquo; Jimmy gave me a bit of an odd look, so I winked at him so she couldn&rsquo;t see. </p>
<p  >His eyes widened in slowly-dawning understanding while she replied softly &ldquo;That&rsquo;s perfectly alright. Jimmy? What about you?&rdquo; I turned my head so she couldn&rsquo;t see my expression and started pointing to myself a little frantically. </p>
<p  >Jimmy said &ldquo;Uhh&hellip;&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t seem to get what I was trying to communicate. I rolled my eyes, pointing to myself then making the universal gesture for &lsquo;sex&rsquo;. I knew I couldn&rsquo;t just keep the sex stuff under wraps&hellip; I needed to talk to <em>somebody</em>. But at the same time, we can&rsquo;t just talk about the exact situation that lead up to all that stuff, people will think we&rsquo;re crazy! Jimmy rose one eyebrow, saying slowly &ldquo;Aaaanal? Anal sex?&rdquo; I blinked before stifling some giggles. Well okay, then. He sounded relieved when he continued &ldquo;Yeah, we were talkin&rsquo; about&hellip; uh, Pete and Gary&rsquo;s&hellip; relationship?&rdquo; I gave a subtle thumbs up even while making a super awkward face. This was still pretty weird. </p>
<p  >The detective&rsquo;s eyebrows had risen quite a bit by now, so I decided to start interjecting. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s, uh, kind of a long story.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy snorted, adding &ldquo;Yeah, no kiddin&rsquo;!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >She nodded, writing on her pad of paper before looking back up at us. &ldquo;Alright, so&hellip; let me try and get this straight&mdash;&rdquo; Jimmy interrupted with a snort of laughter. She blinked at him before continuing &ldquo;&mdash;Pete and Gary were in a sexual relationship?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shook my head frantically, saying &ldquo;No! No, we&rsquo;re not. Well, um. Not anymore.&rdquo; I sighed, looking at Jimmy, saying quietly &ldquo;Look, I think I can talk about it.&rdquo; I had no idea what I was talking about, but he frowned in sympathy and nodded. I took a deep breath before saying &ldquo;Okay&hellip; so. Um. Gary, Jimmy, and I were at summer camp together one year.&rdquo; That was not true at all, and it was scary to be lying this bold-facedly to a cop, but I didn&rsquo;t really see any other options. If we told them the <em>full</em> truth, we&rsquo;d probably be sent to Happy Volts or something! I sure wouldn&rsquo;t put it past this town. &ldquo;And. Well&hellip; Gary started&hellip; doing stuff. To me.&rdquo; I swallowed&mdash;I was looking at the floor, now. &ldquo;It started with just, um, kissing? But then he started doing more stuff&hellip; like&hellip; um. He&hellip;&rdquo; I took a trembling breath with my eyes squeezed shut and forced myself to continue. &ldquo;He sucked me off when I was asleep, once.&rdquo; Phew, at least it was out, now. I looked back up at her; she looked pretty sympathetic as I continued. &ldquo;And it was&hellip; not so bad, I guess, until Jimmy showed up.&rdquo; I nodded over at Jimmy&mdash;I knew I&rsquo;d need to include him at some point, so it was probably best to be as close to the truth as I could. &ldquo;See, I, um&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of friends at, uh, camp. Gary was really the only person who would hang out with me, so I didn&rsquo;t wanna make him upset by saying I didn&rsquo;t like the stuff he was doing, you know?&rdquo; I squirmed in my seat, a little uncomfortable with the attention I was getting from her. Geez&hellip; I just hoped I wouldn&rsquo;t need to repeat myself. &ldquo;Anyway, when Jimmy arrived at, uh, camp, he and I started hanging out. And Gary started using Jimmy as leverage to get me to do&hellip; other things. Like, uh, sucking his dick.&rdquo; I coughed a little. Oh my God this was so awkward! </p>
<p  >Luckily for me, she chose that moment to interrupt. &ldquo;Thank you for telling me all this, Pete. Now, I just need a little clarification. How old were all of you at the time?&rdquo; I swallowed. Shit, I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that&hellip; </p>
<p  >Luckily, Jimmy interjected &ldquo;Like, uh, fourteen.&rdquo; She nodded, scribbling more on her pad. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Thank you. Hm.&rdquo; She then began staring at her notes, then flipping through some other papers before looking back up at us. &ldquo;I think I understand, now. But&hellip; I think I should tell you something.&rdquo; She sighed before continuing. &ldquo;See, my job right now is to try and determine why your f&mdash;Gary died. Essentially, whether or not he was coerced into killing himself, and whether there was something we could have done to prevent it.&rdquo; She bit her lip a bit before going on &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid I cannot rule out foul play from what you&rsquo;ve just told me.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy shot up from his chair and started shouting, which made me flinch &ldquo;What you think we <em>told</em> the psycho to go slit his throat open!?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >She was surprisingly calm when she replied &ldquo;It is certainly possible.&rdquo; It sounded like she was about to continue, but Jimmy interrupted her. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Look, lady. I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, I&rsquo;m pretty happy that the psycho&rsquo;s dead. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we did anything!&rdquo; She nodded as she rose from her seat. Wait, we were done already? </p>
<p  >&ldquo;I understand that. But you do both have the motivation. Personally, I don&rsquo;t think either of you seem like the type to do something like this&hellip;&rdquo; She sighed, rolling her eyes a bit before adding &ldquo;However, some of my colleagues tend to only see the worst in kids.&rdquo; And she did look genuinely sorry as she packed up, saying &ldquo;If I were you two, I would get into contact with your parents and get them to get a lawyer for you right away.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I got up from my chair too, adding &ldquo;But&hellip; but Jimmy&rsquo;s mom is on a cruise! How&rsquo;s she going to get a lawyer for him?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >She looked Jimmy in the eye, asking &ldquo;Do you have a way to contact your mother?&rdquo; He shook his head. Letting out a huff as she tucked a manila folder under her arm, she added &ldquo;Well, then, if you don&rsquo;t have one, I&rsquo;d get in contact with the state. They&rsquo;ll have to provide a lawyer for you if you request one.&rdquo; Was this seriously happening? I get raped by a murderer for a month and I&rsquo;m the one who&rsquo;s in trouble with the law!? She smiled sadly at my expression. &ldquo;I know, I know&hellip; sometimes, the world just isn&rsquo;t fair. Come on, I can walk with you if you have anything else to say.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I frowned, letting my mind go through the events of the other day as all three of us made our way out of the room. &ldquo;But&hellip; but that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense! Why would I tackle Gary off of Jimmy only to just leave him alone if I wanted him dead?&rdquo; I shook my head, adding &ldquo;I mean, I&hellip; I&rsquo;m still close to Gary, I wouldn&rsquo;t just convince him to commit suicide like that!&rdquo; Though, now that I thought about it, it would probably have been easy enough to do if I&rsquo;d really tried. Considering how easily he killed himself&hellip; I shuddered at that. The only thing I had any control over and it was just gone, like a candle that got snuffed out. </p>
<p  >Jimmy added as we made our way down the hall &ldquo;Yeah, the psycho isn&rsquo;t exactly &nbsp; </p>
<p  >&lt;section incomplete&gt;&lt;&hellip;if you couldn&rsquo;t tell by the abrupt sentence cutoff&gt; </p>
<p  >~~~ </p>
<p  >I didn&rsquo;t mean for it to happen like this. Really, the feeling just kept building up but I just ignored it. I hadn&rsquo;t wanted to deal with it; I wanted to put it behind me. &ldquo;Pete for fuck&rsquo;s sake, you&rsquo;re clearly fucked up about it! You gotta do <em>something</em>!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I slammed my locker door shut with a little more force than necessary as I shouldered my bag. &ldquo;Jimmy I spent a whole Goddamn month dealing with nothing <em>but</em> Gary being a psycho! I wanna get back to being normal, what&rsquo;s so wrong with that?&rdquo; Even to me, my words sounded hollow. I felt horrible, mostly because I was <em>mad</em> at <strong>Jimmy</strong>! I wanted to hit him, my best fucking friend! But the guilt was slowly being eclipsed by this weird anger. I knew he understood where I was coming from, probably better than anybody else, but it didn&rsquo;t feel like it. It felt like he didn&rsquo;t understand what I wanted at all. </p>
<p  >In the meantime, Jimmy was groaning. &ldquo;Dude we&rsquo;ve had this conversation like a zillion times! If you wanna be normal so bad you&rsquo;re sure not acting like it.&rdquo; </p>
<p> I tried to tell myself I knew he was right, but right at that moment I was way too pissed to give a shit. &ldquo;Jimmy, can you just maybe <em>shut up</em>?&rdquo; Deep breath. In&hellip; out. In&hellip; out. <span style="font-size: 28.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif; border: none;"> I saw jimmy flinch back, and I knew I had to stop, so I just turned away. &ldquo;Just let me deal with it my way, okay? I can take care of myself.&rdquo; I wanted to add &lsquo;and you&rsquo;, but I wasn't THAT mad. </p>
<p >He growled, but the bell interrupted him and I was able to slip away to Math. Which would be my least favorite class if it weren&rsquo;t for gym. &lt;teacher, stuudent, bad&gt; anyway I set my bag down and started deep breathing. Time for class; Gary isn't around, he can't do anything to hurt me. I'd read that that was a good thing to say to yourself if you were a survivor of... well, you know. But im not sure if it worked the same for me because it just made me feel... more reckless. </p>
<p>The first half of class was okay, but then the teacher called on one of the Jocks who sit behind me and he had to go up and guess the answer to a problem he obviously didn&rsquo;t know. I answered when he asked who knew, and the nerds in the class all laughed at him. I... think his name was Kirby? I still don't know the Jocks' names very well. </p>
<p >After he sat back down and was with his jock buddies again class got way worse. "Pst, pink-shirt!" I got hit with spitballs all through the last half of the period, and they added pencils to the mix in the last few minutes. I dunno why but I hated having to sit there and take it. I&rsquo;d put up with shit way worse than this for so long, but this guy didn't have anything. I mean, except that he could easily beat the crap out of me. Not to mention he had three friends with him. I tried to get out of there as fast as I could after class was over, but I still heard &ldquo;Hey, hey where&rsquo;re you goin&rsquo;!?&rdquo; before I felt somebody grab my shoulder.&lt;&gt; </p>
<p >I ripped out of his grasp, saying desperately &ldquo;Just leave me alone!&rdquo; I got shoved into a nearby wall for my trouble, naturally. </p>
<p >As my backpack opened up and all my stuff spilled onto the floor, I heard the Jocks laughing, along with a couple other voices.&lt;&gt; As I scrambled to pick my papers and stuff up, &lt;I could see a ring forming&gt;. People could sense the fight brewing. &ldquo;haha, what&rsquo;s the matter, you little <em>wuss</em>!?&rdquo; I doubled up at the kick to my side, clutching the math textbook to my chest automatically. He just laughed, as did everybody else. </p>
<p >I scrambled to my feet, holding out a hand. I was desperate, so even though I knew I couldn&rsquo;t talk my way out of it anymore I still said &ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m sorry, I just&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p >He interrupted with a sing-song kind of laugh. &ldquo;Aw, I bet you just wanna run off to your redhead <strong>boyfriend</strong>! Right, faggot?&rdquo; Suddenly, I couldn&rsquo;t hear the chanting of the crowd. I could only hear my own breathing and the distant sound of Gary telling me he loved me, that he would do anything for me. &nbsp;It was lucky for me that the Jock turned around to address the crowd again, because that gave me the opening to slam the textbook in my hand into the side of his head. He went down with a startled &ldquo;Ooof!&rdquo; before I started punching and kicking whatever I could. Face, chest, whatever I could.&lt;didn&rsquo;t matter&gt; </p>
<p >Distantly, I became aware that I was screaming &ldquo;FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU&rdquo; over and over, but I didn&rsquo;t care at the moment. All I wanted was to hurt him, tear his fucking eyes out for what he did&mdash;a small part of me registered my name being shouted nearby, but I was finally paying Gary back for all the shit he put me through and it felt <em>so good</em> to actually be able to hurt him! After a whole month where I couldn&rsquo;t do anything to piss him off, I&rsquo;d been forced to keep to myself, it felt fantastic to just be able to let it all out. I would <strong>never</strong> be that helpless again! After what felt like an eternity, I felt something grab my collar and start pulling me away. What the hell!? I twisted and thrashed as I tried to get out, shouting &ldquo;Let! ME! <em>GO!</em>&rdquo; </p>
<p >I did manage to get a couple of hits in, but then I was being dragged backward and the last thing I saw was an image of the Jock, curling up into a ball before he was swallowed up by the crowd closing in. And in that moment, all I felt was pissed&mdash;pissed that I wasn&rsquo;t able to make him hurt even <em>more</em>. But I was quickly overwhelmed by bodies pressing against me, people shouting, and somebody pulling me backward. I could hear people shouting, but it was far away&mdash;like my ears were stuffed full of cotton. Then, distantly, I heard Jimmy shouting &ldquo;Pete!?&rdquo; </p>
<p >I turned toward the sound, but all I could see was a wall of people. &ldquo;Jimmy!&rdquo; Luckily it seemed that people were heading away from the fight. </p>
<p >Another voice began to filter in&mdash;closer than Jimmy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Move on, nothing to see!&rdquo; I blinked, and turned around to find a Prefect dragging me somewhere as he muttered, &ldquo;Come on, you little shitstains, just try something....&rdquo; </p>
<p >Suddenly, the sounds snapped back into focus as I realized what was happening; I was going to the principal&rsquo;s office for the first time. </p>
<p >&lt;chapter incomplete?&gt; </p>
<p > ~~~~~~ Chapter 3: So How Goes the Talking about Things Thing, Pete?~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I turned my collar up against the March chill that was lingering in the air as I cycled through the streets. Even in Old Bullworth Vale, seemed like winter just wouldn&rsquo;t fucking leave no matter how much money these douchebags threw at it. I rolled my eyes as a couple of Preps waved as I passed. I wouldn&rsquo;t have even bothered kicking their shit in, but their constant bitching had been so fucking annoying I had to do <em>something</em>. It&rsquo;d worked out pretty well, though&mdash;with the trust-fund babies too scared of another humiliating ass-kicking to say no, I&rsquo;d got them to give Pete some boxing lessons. </p>
<p  >As I pulled up in front of Glass Jaw Boxing Club, I groaned to myself when I saw the lights were still on. Jesus, again? It&rsquo;s the fifth time this month&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t bother knocking&mdash;I&rsquo;d be able to wipe the floor with any assholes hanging around anyway. I sighed when the sound of somebody hitting a punching bag reached my ears. Pete was still here, and it looked like he&rsquo;d been at it a while. &ldquo;Hey, man. Still goin&rsquo; at it?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say anything though, just kept punching. I frowned. &ldquo;  Yo, Pete! Hey!  &rdquo; But he was really in the zone. Okay, this was getting fucking stupid. I reached out to grab his shoulder and said, &ldquo;Come on, dude, snap out of it!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;  GAH!  &rdquo; He flinched away as soon as I touched him before turning around. His eyes had that &lsquo;holyshitfuck&rsquo; look that you see on deer when they dart in front of cars in movies, and breathing really hard. Then he blinked, and shook his head like he was clearing it, &ldquo;&hellip;oh, hey Jimmy,&rdquo; After a moment he turned back around and resumed hitting the bag. &ldquo;What&rsquo;  s up?  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >I folded my arms across my chest. I was fucking done with this. &ldquo;Pete, you gotta tell me what&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo; He seemed to stop for a bit, but kept at what he was doing without turning around. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s wrong. I&rsquo;  m fine.  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snorted at that. &ldquo;Bullshit, Pete. You don&rsquo;t wanna talk about it? Fine. How about I guess, then, hm?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say anything. &ldquo;&lsquo;Kay. Somethin&rsquo; about the psycho?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >His fist connected with the bag, but he didn&rsquo;t move it away, just kept it there. &ldquo;  No.  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s about something <em>other</em> than the whole &lsquo;kidnapped and forced into sex&rsquo; thing?&rdquo; At that, he leaned forward and rested his forehead on the bag, unclenching his fist. </p>
<p  >He sighed,   &ldquo;&hellip;it isn&rsquo;t <em>just</em> about Gary,&rdquo; before pushing off from the bag, turning to go into the locker room, never looking at me. &ldquo;  We  &rsquo;ve discussed this&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I growled, following him. &ldquo;Yeah, well, your &lsquo;not talking about it&rsquo; strategy isn&rsquo;t fucking working, okay?&rdquo; He was ignoring everything I was saying, just calmly gathering his things into his bag. &ldquo;Come on, please&hellip; just <em>talk</em> to me! I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; I rubbed my arm. I don&rsquo;t usually talk like this, but this is Pete&mdash;he&rsquo;s special. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like seeing you like this, man.&rdquo; That at least gave him some pause. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;what if you don&rsquo;t like what I have to say?&rdquo; I frowned. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you talking about? Say whatever you need to, man; I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >But he shook his head, straightening up with his bag over his shoulder. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want to hear it.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I balled my fists at my sides; what the fuck!? &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why ya gotta <em>tell</em>   me! I  &rsquo;m never gonna fuckin&rsquo; know what you&rsquo;re thinking if you don&rsquo;t just come out and say it!&rdquo; We finally made eye contact for the first time, staying that way for a few moments before he started glaring. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Okay. Fine. You want to know what&rsquo;s wrong? It&rsquo;s not <em>just</em> Gary. It&rsquo;s <em>you</em>, and it&rsquo;s me too, <em>okay</em>?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I leaned back and folded my arms again. &ldquo;No, I still don&rsquo;t get it. How&rsquo;s there anything wrong with <em>you</em>  ?  &rdquo; He groaned, clutching tighter at the strap over his shoulder. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo; He looked down, avoiding my eyes as his face turned red and he mumbled, &ldquo;Lets&hellip; let&rsquo;s just say I used to masturbate to <em>girls</em>, okay?&rdquo; I blinked. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;Oh.&rdquo; &hellip;shit, it&rsquo;d be pretty hyprocritical of me to criticize him for jerkin&rsquo; off to Gary&hellip; I shrugged. &ldquo;Hey, girls are fine, but guys aren&rsquo;t so bad either, amiright?&rdquo; Pete looked up from the ground, and gave a pretty tired laugh, nodding a bit. He seemed a little relieved. &ldquo;&lsquo;kay, so what&rsquo;s your beef with <em>me</em>  ?  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >That made him stiffen, before sighing and walking past me into the gym proper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; just&hellip; you mentioned something about me  <em> liking </em>  being a&hellip; sex&hellip; slave. Once.&rdquo; I winced, avoiding eye-contact; I did remember saying something like that. &ldquo;I just&hellip; I feel bad because a part of me&hellip; <em>misses</em> Gary.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >That made me freeze. &lsquo;Cause <em>shit</em>, I miss Gary too&mdash;but Pete&hellip; he couldn&rsquo;t mean like <em>that</em>, right? &ldquo;Whadya<em> mean</em> you &lsquo;miss&rsquo; him?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Something about that question must&rsquo;ve been like opening the floodgates, because suddenly it was like he couldn&rsquo;t stop talking. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, sometimes it felt so <em>good</em> you know? Like, I&rsquo;ve never felt anything like that with anybody! And it was so creepy, too, and just so weird that it wasn&rsquo;t always fun I guess, but then it&rsquo;s like sometimes he&rsquo;d say these really smart things that showed how knowledgeable he was and then a second later he&rsquo;d say something that was <em>super</em> personal but if you showed him that you&rsquo;d noticed he&rsquo;d get all defensive like nobody else was allowed to understand him and God I <em>had</em> to get to know him, how else could I have kept him from hurting us!? If I hadn&rsquo;t learned about him and understood him could I have just let myself hate him? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was hearing! &ldquo;The fuck do you <em>mean</em> &lsquo;understand him&rsquo;!? He was just some crazy person that fucking <em>kidnaped </em>you into<em> sexual slavery</em>  !  &rdquo; Pete turned on his heel at that, stalking right up to me so he was all up in my face. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yeah, well at least I think of him as a <em>person</em>  ! He  &rsquo;s not even  <em> human </em>  to you&mdash;you act like everything he did was some personal attack, but he clearly couldn&rsquo;t even understand the consequences of his actions!&rdquo; He shoved me back in time with his point. &ldquo;He <em>slit</em> his own <em>throat</em> for fuck&rsquo;s sake! How can you possibly expect somebody like that to act like his actions affect us?&rdquo; God this was SUCH horse shit. </p>
<p  >I sneered   &ldquo;Oh boo fucking hoo, the poor widdle psycho doesn&rsquo;t understand what <em>killing yourself</em> means, I guess I should feel FUCKING SORRY for him now!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Pete shouted back, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;ve <em>forgiven</em> him for all the shit he did! I&rsquo;m just saying I get that he didn&rsquo;t <em>mean</em> to hurt us!&rdquo; He leaned back and threw his hands up in the air. &ldquo;Hell, he didn&rsquo;t even think we&rsquo;d remember!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&rsquo;He didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d remember&rsquo;!? &ldquo;So <strong>FUCKING</strong> what!?&rdquo; I had to clench my fists so hard that my nails were digging into my palms so I wouldn&rsquo;t just grab him and fucking beating this fucking moon logic outta him. Instead I raised the volume again. &ldquo;Who gives a <strong>fuck</strong> what he thought would happen, the little shitstain still did it!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Pete&rsquo;s voice was getting real shrill&mdash;I was surprised it hadn&rsquo;t cracked yet. &ldquo;What, do you <em>like</em> hating him for it!? I know what he did, I want to wring his <em>fucking</em> neck, but I hate feeling this way even more!&rdquo; He stopped for a moment to glare at his arms, which were trembling even as he tried to clasp his hands together to stop the shaking. He sighed again, but his voice dropped even below his usual volume. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you just wish you could&hellip; let go?&rdquo; The fast-rising anger I&rsquo;d felt churning in my gut stopped and I took a sec to catch my breath. Talk about mood whiplash. In the meantime, Pete stopped gripping his arms so tight and glanced behind him, outside. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure, I usually wish I could just&hellip;&rdquo; he gestured vaguely as he turned back to face me. &ldquo;&hellip;forget it all and pretend it never happened, which, yeah, impossible, duh. But sometimes I wish I could just move on instead of having to constantly fucking think about it.&rdquo; He gave a little chuckle. &ldquo;Which is almost just as crazy; I don&rsquo;t even know if I <em>could</em> ever&hellip;&rdquo; He trailed off as I finally caught the rest of my breath. </p>
<p  >I narrowed my eyes, snorted and smiled a bit.&lt;leave it to peter fucking kowalski to wanna forgive an asshole like that. Hell I still have those fucked up &lsquo;kidnapper/kidnapee&rsquo; dreams sometimes. I shrugged, sighing. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re just better than me, Pete.&rdquo; He started at that. </p>
<p  >I noticed that the shaking in his arms stopped as he gesticulated. &ldquo;What? Of course not!&rdquo;   He sighed.   &ldquo;I understand why you feel the way you do, I was just&hellip; trying to explain my reasoning for how I feel. Or&hellip; how I want to feel, I guess.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I slapped my forehead. &ldquo;Oh shit, yeah, I was the one who asked <em>you</em> anyway. Sheesh.&rdquo; I laughed, and before long he joined in too. </p>
<p  >We shared a laugh at our own expense before he sighed contentedly and said &ldquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s head back to school. You know,&rdquo; He added, adjusting the strap of his bag on his shoulder as he moved toward the door, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m getting a lot better at this fighting stuff!&rdquo; I snorted. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a world of difference between a boxing match and <em>actual</em> fighting, Pete.&rdquo; I paused, then cuffed him lightly in the shoulder. &ldquo;But yeah, you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo;   pretty badass!  &rdquo; He laughed as we entered the biting chill of &lsquo;spring&rsquo;. I sighed, and added &ldquo;  Look, I  &hellip; don&rsquo;t get why you think all this stuff about the ps&mdash;Gary, or whatever. But&hellip; it&rsquo;s your brain, so&hellip; you can think whatever you want, okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He smiled, and Goddamnit but that was cute.   &ldquo;Thanks, man.&rdquo; His expression turned a bit cocky then, and he added, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not just saying that because I can punch you now, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I laughed at that. &ldquo;Pft! You might be badass, but you&rsquo;  ll never be as badass as  <em> me </em> !  &rdquo; And we shared quips as we headed back to the dorms.&lt;weee are fu*king family?&gt; </p>
<p > ~~~~~~ Chapter 4: Why Can&rsquo;t Gary Hold All These Feels~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I blinked my way back to consciousness for the second time in what felt like a half-hour. They had remembered a loop. I stared at the celling, trying to wrap my head around it. It was completely unthinkable&mdash;I&rsquo;ve done <em>horrible</em> things to them for <em>centuries</em> and suddenly <strong>now</strong> they remember it!? I sat up, scanning the snoozing Petey suspiciously. I&rsquo;d been so certain that resetting would reset their memories a few minutes ago, but now that I thought about it I wasn&rsquo;t so sure. </p>
<p  >I got up and moved over to his bed, preparing to wake him up the way I usually do. I&rsquo;ve done this plenty of times before, so if he just groaned at me I could probably assume that it had worked. I tried not to think too hard about what I&rsquo;d do if it hadn&rsquo;t. Letting myself fall directly on his stomach, I heard the usual grunt of pain before starting with a cheerful, &ldquo;Rise and shine, Femme Boy! Time t&ndash;  &rdquo;   But Petey&rsquo;s fist abruptly connected with my jaw, cutting the rest of my sentence down to &ldquo;  &ndash;AAAAHEGH!  &rdquo; I staggered back, surprise and pain making me fall to my butt on the floor. A few moments later, I chuckled as I rubbed my jaw&mdash;fuck, that&rsquo;d <em>hurt</em>  !   &ldquo;Well! I guess that answers <em>that</em>   question.  &rdquo; I glanced up at him, curious now. What exactly did Petey remember? Had the loop reset as soon as I&rsquo;d died? I got back to my knees, propping my elbows up on his bed, looking him over. He was rubbing the fist that had just punched me with an expression of mild surprise. I snorted, saying, &ldquo;Yeah, punching people tends to hurt, doesn&rsquo;t it Femme Boy?&rdquo; His eyes snapped to me, and he scowled. </p>
<p  >Moving to get off the bed, he said, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t hurt that much the other day.&rdquo; Then, more to himself, he added, &ldquo;Guess our bodies really do revert to how they were before....&rdquo; He was looking at his fist, clenching it rather hard. </p>
<p  >He moved in a large circle to avoid walking past me to get to his wardrobe, and I chuckled a little. &ldquo;&lsquo;the other day&rsquo;? Come on Femme Boy, don&rsquo;t tell me <em>you</em> were <em>punching</em> people while I was gone!&rdquo; As he closed his wardrobe, pink shirt and kakis in hand, he gave me a very level look. He didn&rsquo;t say anything, though, just moved in the same wide berth around me to get to the door. I rolled my eyes, getting to my feet and saying after him &ldquo;Hey, come on Petey&mdash;you said you wanted to talk!&rdquo; I followed him out of the room and to the stairwell&mdash;he seemed to be moving toward the bathroom. &ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t we talk, hm?&rdquo; The blonde Bully then bashed into Petey and, tripping him as he passed, I continued to follow Petey downstairs. I frowned. He  <em> still </em>  wouldn&rsquo;t even acknowledge that he could hear me. &ldquo;Hey, come on, I&rsquo;m not going to do anything <em>now</em>. I can&rsquo;t even predict when you&rsquo;re going to punch me, for God&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;   We  &rsquo;d reached the basement where the laundry and bath rooms were, and he was still giving me the cold shoulder. I growled. <em>Seriously</em>!? Petey is <em>the</em> most interesting thing within a five-hundred mile radius, and he&rsquo;s going to just ignore me? No fucking way. I grabbed his arm &ldquo;Hey, will you just <em>listen</em>  ?&mdash;&rdquo;   but he immediately ripped his arm out of my grasp, turning around and glaring at me with <em>fury</em>. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Hey Gary, here&rsquo;s an idea; why don&rsquo;t you just <em>never FUCKING talk to me again</em>  !?  &rdquo; He was shaking, and pressed one of his hands to his forehead; I&rsquo;ll admit, for a second I was almost scared. I&rsquo;d never seen him like this, like he was trying to keep himself from beating the shit out of me! When he spoke again, he was considerably quieter. &ldquo;  Look. I  &rsquo;m still trying to deal with&hellip;&rdquo; Here he popped his exposed eye open, gesturing vaguely in my general direction. &ldquo;&hellip;<em>you</em>, okay? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready to actually, like, <em>talk</em> to you.&rdquo; He turned around without looking at me, walking into one of the bathroom stalls. </p>
<p  >I frowned; what did that actually <em>mean</em>? &ldquo;So&hellip; what? Am I supposed to just ignore you for the next eight months? You and <em>Jimmy</em> of all people are now literally the most interesting things on the planet!&rdquo; Seriously, I wasn&rsquo;t about to just let them mess around and not watch how it affected everything I&rsquo;d memorized over the past centuries! </p>
<p  >Petey emerged from the stall, fully dressed, and pointedly didn&rsquo;t glance in my direction when he moved over to the sinks. &ldquo;Whatever; I&rsquo;m just saying if you <em>do</em> follow us around I can&rsquo;t claim responsibility for my actions, okay?&rdquo; He splashed some water on his face as I considered his words. </p>
<p  >When he was done, I responded &ldquo;Well, how about I just kill myself again?&rdquo; I shrugged when Petey whipped around with a horrified look. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be easier than trying to resist the temptation to follow <em>literally the only people who matter</em>.&rdquo; I rolled my eyes to emphasize my point. </p>
<p  >But he shook his head, saying, &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t <em>kill</em> yourself, geez! Just&hellip; don&rsquo;t&hellip; interact with us at all? Okay?&rdquo; I frowned as I followed him back upstairs. That was an annoying limitation. But I sighed when I saw that his back muscles were tensed; it was the least I could do. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Okay, then.&rdquo; As we headed up the stairwell, I split off from Femme Boy without a word. Figured I should put real clothes on before following them around for the rest of the day. As I was getting dressed, I grabbed a few pieces of paper and forged some teacher&rsquo;s notes to get me into Petey&rsquo;s classes. Nothing I hadn&rsquo;t done before. Moving to leave the room, I realized that he had left his bookbag here. I shrugged and started packing it up&mdash;that didn&rsquo;t necessarily count as &lsquo;interaction&rsquo;, after all. Glancing out the window, I saw the moron walking up to the customary welcome wagon. I frowned thoughtfully as I swung Petey&rsquo;s backpack on as I made my way out. How would Jimmy react to all this? Judging from the last loop, <em>he</em> had far less goodwill towards me than Petey, surprisingly enough. When I got downstairs I found Femme Boy pacing in front of Jimmy&rsquo;s room. I was about to ask why he didn&rsquo;t just go out and meet the moron himself, but I stopped myself just in time. I didn&rsquo;t make eye contact, just dropped his backpack next to him before walking over to the wall across from Jimmy&rsquo;s room and waiting for the show to begin. Sure enough, a few seconds later the moron walked in and, as soon as he caught sight of me, scowled and started walking in my direction, ready for a fight. I gave him a quick scan&mdash;it didn't seem like he'd gone though as many people this time around, sticking mostly to the "default" sequence of events. Unfortunately for me that meant he was very ready for a fight. I breathed deep; I'd have to avoid any lethal methods, obviously, but I could probably handle it even without my knife. Enough to get away, at least. </p>
<p  >But Petey said &ldquo;  Jimmy, come on  &mdash;we talked about this&rdquo; which stopped him dead in his tracks. Huh? I flicked my gaze between the two of them; what on <em>Earth</em> had they 'talked about' to get Jimmy to stop like that? He angled his body so that he could address Petey too, never taking his eyes off me. </p>
<p  >He growled &ldquo;You <em>sure</em>, Pete? Believe me, I don&rsquo;t mind&rdquo; as he cracked his knuckles in what I&rsquo;m sure would have been an intimidating gesture to anybody else. I scoffed; somebody had forgotten who had been strangling who to death last time. </p>
<p  >Petey sighed.   &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; Then he snorted, adding &ldquo;Besides, I already decked him in the face.&rdquo; That made Jimmy laugh, and he smiled at Petey, punching him lightly in the shoulder as he walked into his dorm room. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Haha, that&rsquo;s awesome, dude!&rdquo; Petey rolled his eyes despite the grin he was sporting as Jimmy shouted from the inside of his room while he was changing. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;djya get &lsquo;  im?  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >I looked away as Petey shouted back &ldquo;On the jaw&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t really help, though.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t avoid hearing Jimmy&rsquo;s laugh.&lt; Or the quickly-returning jealousy.&gt; </p>
<p  >I watched as one of the Bullies stuffed Pee-stain into the trashcan while Jimmy emerged from his room to add, &ldquo;Guess they don&rsquo;t call it Glass Jaw Gym for no reason, huh?&rdquo; That made me quirk one eyebrow questioningly at him. What the hell did <em>that</em> have to do with anything? </p>
<p  >Petey, on the other hand, shouldered his bag with a sigh, like he&rsquo;d heard that one too many times before. &ldquo;You know Jimmy, just &lsquo;cause somebody&rsquo;s rich doesn&rsquo;t automatically make them an asshole.&rdquo; He snorted as Petey stopped to pull Pee-stain out of the trash can before the two made their way out of the dorm. I followed, fascinated by the new conversation despite the quickly-returning jealousy. </p>
<p  >I couldn&rsquo;t see his face, but I could hear the eye roll in Jimmy&rsquo;s next line. &ldquo;Name <em>one</em> person who&rsquo;s rich and isn&rsquo;t a complete tool, Pete.&rdquo; Pete held the door open for a while before I realized <em>I</em> was supposed to exit, as well.  </p>
<p  >He had his gaze fixed firmly on Jimmy as he talked. &ldquo;Bill Gates isn&rsquo;t an asshole&mdash;isn&rsquo;t he trying to cure polio or something?&rdquo; The moron snorted like that was the most ridiculous thing he&rsquo;d ever heard. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Somebody you <em>know</em>, Pete, not some famous dude.&rdquo; That seemed to give Femme Boy pause as the two went on their way to the school building. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;I don&rsquo;t really know any rich people, though. I mean&hellip;&rdquo; and he glanced at me before quickly looking forward again and quietly adding, &ldquo;Besides the obvious.&rdquo; I felt a lightbulb go off in my head&mdash;they were talking about <em>me</em>. Huh. Odd&mdash;I&rsquo;ve avoided my family for so long that I&rsquo;d almost forgot that technically, my family <em>is</em> rich. </p>
<p  >Jimmy shrugged. &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ve known <em>tons</em> of rich people. Never met one I liked.&rdquo; He paused as I tagged after them up the steps to the school, adding &ldquo;&lsquo;Cept that Pinkie girl. She&rsquo;s alright, I guess.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Pete snickered. &ldquo;Leave it to you to think a <em>girl</em> is the only redeeming aspect of some group.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy grinned as he pushed the door open. &ldquo;Hey, I know what I like!&rdquo; He made sure to shut the door on me as I was walking through. </p>
<p  >When I caught up to them, Pete had his &lsquo;pretty sure you&rsquo;re talking out your ass&rsquo; face on. &ldquo;But you said she&rsquo;s, like, racist against poor people, or something.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy shrugged, chuckling. &ldquo;Yeah, I know&mdash;and she&rsquo;s the <em>least</em> terrible I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo; Pete looked sad at that. I rolled my eyes; God, who cares? The preps will <em>always</em> be assholes. I would know, I&rsquo;m technically one of them. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What about, um&hellip; George? The gay one?&rdquo; Pete pushed the classroom door open, coughing a bit at the waft of chemicals that came out of the classroom before continuing. &ldquo;&hellip;You seem&ndash;&rdquo; he coughed &ldquo;&ndash;to like him.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Gord. And he&rsquo;s okay&mdash;he&rsquo;s kinda fake-racist like Pinkie, but I had to beat the entirety of the Preps before he&rsquo;d even look my way. So&hellip; also a dick.&rdquo; As I dropped my bag next to the table in front of them, Jimmy turned to glare at me. &ldquo;Hey, the fuck&rsquo;re you doing here? Don&rsquo;tchya have your own class to get to?&rdquo; I shot him a patronizing look as I pulled out one of the notes I&rsquo;d written earlier and walked up to the front of the class. </p>
<p  >The teacher had finally remembered that there was class today, and I handed him the note right before he started roll call. He glared at it, then at me, suspiciously. &ldquo;Just for today, then?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Ugh. It&rsquo;d been <em>decades</em> since I&rsquo;d needed to interact with these idiots at length&mdash;there&rsquo;s so little they can teach me anymore, after all. </p>
<p  >He sighed, as if this was some sort of hardship despite the fact that it would literally change <em>nothing</em> about the lesson. &ldquo;Very well, take one of the open seats. And <em>don&rsquo;t</em> fall behind&ndash;  &rdquo;   then, to the whole class, &ldquo;Today we&rsquo;ll be working with volatile chemicals, so you&rsquo;ll need to follow my instructions <em>precisely</em>.&rdquo; I turned around and rolled my eyes as I took my place. I already knew what we were doing today. I was <em>much</em> more interested in the two people behind me. </p>
<p  >I turned in my seat to see a sneering Hopkins. &ldquo;Well aren&rsquo;t you fuckin&rsquo; smart.&rdquo; I smirked, shrugging. How nice of him to notice. He just glared, adding, &ldquo;Whatever asshole&mdash;  stop  <em> staring </em> , it&rsquo;s fucking creepy.&rdquo; He was probably right; Petey was paying a <em>lot</em> of attention to a lesson that he&rsquo;d already experienced thrice. I sighed, turning around. I guess staring counted as &lsquo;interaction&rsquo;. </p>
<p  >It&rsquo;d been a while, but if there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;m proud of it&rsquo;s my memory. I had the assignment done in ten minutes, which meant I had to spend the rest of the class trying to not creep Petey out too much. I sighed. &ldquo;How did you <em>do</em> that!?&rdquo; I turned to the other person sitting at my table&mdash;just the black Nerd. </p>
<p  >I shrugged, glancing behind me at the important people as I talked. &ldquo;When you see the same thing fifty times, it tends to sink in.&rdquo; Jimmy was doing surprisingly well. Petey was having more trouble&mdash;he was biting his lip, and it was cute as hell. I smiled a little, until he looked up and flinched in disgust when he noticed me. </p>
<p  >Jimmy was helping Petey, trying to explain what the teacher was doing. &ldquo;Ya just gotta put in the right ones at the right time, you know?&rdquo; Petey sighed, looking at his sorry mixture in dismay. Jimmy picked up one of the tubes on Pete&rsquo;s side of the table and held it out to him. &ldquo;Like, look&hellip; see, you gotta think of each of &lsquo;em like they&rsquo;re shapes, right?&rdquo; I was staring at Jimmy now. What was he <em>talking</em> about? Petey was staring at him too, but he was trying to reign in the confusion. Jimmy pointed the tube at the board. &ldquo;See, when he says &lsquo;potassium&rsquo;, you gotta think &lsquo;triangle&rsquo;, right? And this&rdquo; here he held out the test-tube for Femme Boy to inspect &ldquo;is the &lsquo;triangle&rsquo; tube. Easy, right?&rdquo; Petey&rsquo;s eyebrows were practically on top of his head they were raised so high&mdash;he slowly shook his head. Jimmy sighed. &ldquo;Man&hellip; I dunno how to explain it, man, it&rsquo;s just&hellip;&rdquo; And he began looking around the room before he laid eyes on the Nerd to my left. &ldquo;Hey! Hey, Cornelius!&rdquo; he started at being addressed, before turning around to look at &lsquo;the new kid&rsquo; dismissively. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;<em>Some</em> of us are trying to work here, yo<sub>u know...</sub>&rdquo; but he trailed off as I leaned toward him and inclined my head in Femme Boy&rsquo;s direction. It didn&rsquo;t count if I wasn&rsquo;t interacting with <em>them</em>, right? &ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy addressed me first &ldquo;Butt out, psycho!&rdquo; before turning to the Nerd and saying &ldquo;Hey you wanna help me explain this shit to my friend?&rdquo; He gestured toward Petey who gave an apologetic wave. </p>
<p  >The Nerd looked a bit weirded out, but said hesitantly &ldquo;Um&hellip; I&rsquo;m kind of having trouble myself&hellip;&rdquo; Then he pointed to me, adding &ldquo;I think he would be better suited. He&rsquo;s already done anyway&rdquo; before turning around to resume his work. Jimmy blinked before staring at me and scowling. It was so strange&mdash;usually I didn&rsquo;t see that kind of Murder face until the Hole, at least. I shifted my gaze to Petey, who was tugging on Jimmy&rsquo;s sleeve and clearly avoiding looking at me. He convinced Jimmy to keep trying to explain what he was thinking, and he did, reluctantly. I felt a sudden realization wash over me. Everything was <em>different</em> now. </p>
<p  >Suddenly, I couldn&rsquo;t stand being in the same room as either of them&mdash;I dropped the container of liquid on the teacher&rsquo;s desk as I left the room. I told the prefects that I was on my way to the bathroom without thinking about it, and before I knew it I was there. I was greatful for the privacy as I walked up to a sink and started staring at my reflection; I don&rsquo;t look any different. It&rsquo;s been so long I can&rsquo;t even remember what I looked like before I had the scar, or the hairstyle. When did I even get my hair cut like this? But I <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> the same. And now somebody else knew, too. </p>
<p  >Jimmy and Petey knew me for what I <em>really</em> was&mdash;I&rsquo;d never been able to get him to side with me when I was obsessed with taking over the school, and I&rsquo;d never been able to get him to date me, but this was different. Not being able to manipulate somebody is one thing&hellip; but they <em>know</em> me, now. I raised a hand to my neck, even checking in the mirror, but there wasn&rsquo;t a scar. Obviously. But if slitting my throat hadn&rsquo;t reset their memories&mdash;nothing would. I was <em>stuck</em> with them. Forever. I let my hand fall, gripping the sink. </p>
<p  >What was terrifying was how part of me <em>wanted</em> it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never been one for genuine connection with other humans even before being stuck in the time loops, but countless people had been paid or had tried to &lsquo;  understand  &rsquo; my various psychoses. usually anybody that I genuinely enjoy spending time with is because they didn&rsquo;t try to &lsquo;get&rsquo; me&mdash; Petey, case in point. Now, though; I squeezed my eyes shut as I recalled the month-long excursion with them&mdash;I&rsquo;d been putty in his hands, and he <em>knew</em>. Getting me to drive them, giving Jimmy free reign, even the blowjob, to some extent. He knew how to play me because he <em>got</em> me. </p>
<p  >I leaned my forehead against the cool glass, continuing my train of thought. The same, oddly enough, went for the moron. He understood me all too well, too&mdash;he just hadn&rsquo;t had the luxury of being able to manipulate me. So he did what he does best; trying to hurt or fuck anything that gets in his way. I sighed, feeling my breath fog up the glass a bit. I opened my eyes and moved back, making eye-contact with my reflection. I couldn&rsquo;t just kill myself now&hellip; Petey had told me not to. And God knows I can&rsquo;t go against something he told me to do. I suddenly flashed on him giving me that blowjob, but now from <em>his</em> perspective&hellip; all that fear, the disgust&hellip; he remembered it <em>all</em>. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;Fuck.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t want to stick around to see more of <em>that</em>. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 5: The Big Match~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I was nervous. I see these guys almost every day nowadays, but usually that&rsquo;s just in passing as I stuff earbuds in and ignore everybody else while I work out. Now, I was the center of attention as Preps surrounded the boxing ring and grumbled about &lsquo;some scrawny, middle-class nobody&rsquo;. I was just glad Jimmy was there to talk to me. He&rsquo;d taken it upon himself to be my &lsquo;coach&rsquo;, and had even insisted on putting a towel on my shoulders before the match because it, apparently, &lsquo;looked cool&rsquo;. He was also doing the standard sports movie pre-match pep talk. &ldquo;Don't fucking listen to these pussies, Pete! You got this, come on!&rdquo; I looked over at Bif in the other corner uncertainly as he rolled his neck like this was no big deal. </p>
<p  >I turned back toward Jimmy, who looked like he was excited as <em>hell</em>. I wished I could feel as excited as he looked. &ldquo;I.. I don&rsquo;t know, man, this.. um, I&rsquo;m not so sure about this now&hellip;&rdquo; I let out a heavy sigh. Being able to prove to myself that I could fight had sounded a lot more appealing when it only involved hypothetical violence. </p>
<p  >He clapped me on the shoulder. &ldquo;Come on, dude! You've been working for this for so long!&rdquo; I gave him a side-long look; no matter how hard it worked, a fish couldn&rsquo;t climb a tree. He just gave me a confident smirk. &ldquo;Trust me, man. If you can hold your own against <em>me</em>, Bif don&rsquo;t stand a fuckin&rsquo; chance,&rdquo; I looked back at the other boy on the other side of the boxing ring; he was utterly relaxed, as if he wasn&rsquo;t even worried. It was true, I <em>had</em> gotten to the point where I can hold my own against Jimmy&hellip; Right behind my head, he continued &ldquo;Lookat &lsquo;im&mdash;&rdquo; He nudged me knowingly as he talked, like we were sharing in a secret. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t even know what you&rsquo;re fuckin&rsquo; capable of, dude!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I looked at the floor, and I was ninety-percent sure I was blushing like crazy at the praise. &ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;m not that good&hellip;&rdquo; At that Jimmy grabbed my shoulders and turned me decisively around to face him, giving me a serious look. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Pete, you are <em>seriously</em> going to kick this guy&rsquo;s ass. Okay? I <em>promise</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I smiled at him. &ldquo;Thanks so much, Jimmy.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He just shrugged, leaning his forehead against mine. &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;re friends for?&rdquo; That contact actually started to steady my nerves&mdash;it reminded me of that windy night in a trailer somewhere in New York. I could <em>do</em> this. This was what I&rsquo;d been working for! I pulled away, giving Jimmy a more determined smile and nod. The bell then rang to begin the round, and Jimmy grinned at me, saying &ldquo;Go get &lsquo;em, tiger!&rdquo; before stepping down from the ring. I smiled to myself&mdash;I really am lucky to have a friend like Jimmy. </p>
<p  >Turning around, I walked up to meet Bif in the middle of the ring. The larger boy looked down (wayyy down) at me piteously. &ldquo;<em>Wow</em>. You <em>sure</em> you wanna go up against the <em>champ</em>, kid?&rdquo; and he tapped one gloved hand to my chest. &ldquo;I mean, come on!&rdquo; lightly pushing both gloves on my chest to emphasize his point, he added cockily &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t even need t  o <em>try</em> with you, <em>loser</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I smirked&mdash;Jimmy was right, I really did feel ready. I shrugged, saying as respectfully as I could &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m sure you have nothing to worry about,&rdquo; To be fair, I couldn&rsquo;t blame Bif for not finding me intimidating; I wouldn&rsquo;t have been scared of a kid a whole head shorter than me, either. </p>
<p  >I took a deep breath and locked my gaze on the Prep&rsquo;s face, letting myself enter the numbing state of mind where I couldn&rsquo;t hear anything, just my own breath. I spent the first minute or so dodging jabs,   getting used to Bif&rsquo;s fighting style. The larger boy focused on landing powerful hits and blocking&mdash;the only time I could get a hit in was when his attacks left him exposed somehow. As the round progressed, Bif became increasingly frustrated with his inability to hit me. Though he managed to land several hits, I recovered pretty well from each so he couldn&rsquo;t chain hits like he clearly wanted to. He&rsquo;d started to resort to taunting, but it really wasn&rsquo;t very effective. Most of it was about my lack of wealth, which just made me roll my eyes; wow, a Prep teasing somebody about money. How original. </p>
<p  >Jimmy shook my shoulder as the round ended and I made my way to the corner, very out of breath, but satisfied. Dodging all those power hits takes a lot out of me, but it&rsquo;s kinda fun. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing great! Just two more rounds to go and you&rsquo;ll have proof you can deal with <em>any</em> psychos that show up, right?&rdquo; Jimmy waved a water bottle in my face, sporting a grin. I smiled briefly as I took the bottle&mdash;I was more worried about sucking the water down. Jimmy kept talking&mdash;he was practically hopping up and down he was so excited. &ldquo;Okay, so you got <em>really</em> good right at the end there. Whatever you did, keep doing it and that bullshit title is as good as <em>yours</em>, man!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Clapping me on the shoulder one last time, he hopped down just as the bell to begin the next round rung. </p>
<p  >Bif didn&rsquo;t bother with any subtly, opening with a right hook.   I dodged only to realize it was a feint, since the left half of my face erupted into pain. Shit&mdash;I had to get out of range. I hopped back, letting the force of the blow move me away. Bif was clearly <em>very</em> frustrated&mdash; I&rsquo;m a far cry from a heavy hitter, but I had become <em>very</em> good at expending a minimal amount of energy to dodge opponents. I'd trained with Jimmy, after all, and he&rsquo;s really light on his feet for somebody who&rsquo;s so strong. I shook my head&mdash;mind on the MATCH!&mdash;only to need to roll out of range of another powerful hit. I heard the larger boy growl at his opponent slipping from his grasp yet again. "What's the matter, pauper, are you afraid I might put you on <em>welfare</em>!?" </p>
<p  >I knew I needed to get some damage in, so I switched from defense to offence. Unfortunately, that left me open and I ended up face-down on the mat by the middle of the round. As I gritted my teeth and dragged myself up, Jimmy yelled at me &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, Pete! Pretend he&rsquo;s Gary or some shit!&rdquo; I flinched at the name as I finished getting up before turning back to Bif but did my best to ignore it. Come on! I could do this! </p>
<p  >Unfortunately, it seemed Bif had heard Jimmy. &ldquo;Gary? Who&rsquo;s Gary, loser?&rdquo; I had mostly been keeping a neutral expression up until this point since I was concentrating. But when he mentioned Gary, my face automatically twisted into a scowl. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Shut up, man,&rdquo; Bif grinned as I looked for an opening&mdash;unfortunately, it seemed they don&rsquo;t give out that champion title to just anybody; he really is a good boxer. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Ah, it speaks! I didn&rsquo;t know poor people <em>could</em> talk!&rdquo; He laughed as I flicked my eyes to the clock. There were only fifteen seconds left! &ldquo;Ah, that Gary Smith boy, right?&rdquo; I stiffened. &ldquo;Ha, he your boyfriend or something? That why he hasn&rsquo;t been around?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I spat &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; before I could stop myself. I could feel the rage simmering just beneath the surface&mdash;I was already warm from the physical exercise, but it felt like my skin was suddenly <em>too</em> hot. As the bell rang, I knew I&rsquo;d made a mistake from Bif&rsquo;s cocky grin at knowing my &lsquo;weakness&rsquo;. </p>
<p  >Retreating to my own corner, I tried to get myself back under control. &ldquo;Hey, you all right?&rdquo; I shot Jimmy a pleading look, shaking my head. I flashed suddenly on Gary running his tongue over my dick and flinched. God, not <em>now!</em> &ldquo;No, man, that&rsquo;s good! Imagine Bif is Gary, okay? You just gotta channel it right.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shook my head, voice desperate. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s <em>not</em> Gary!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy looked like he was about to say something, but the third bell rung at that point; he threw me a thumbs-up and added quickly &ldquo;You can do it!&rdquo; as he hopped down. Welp. I turned back to the center of the ring, trying to ignore the flood of images that had decided to overtake my brain. </p>
<p  >It must&rsquo;ve shown on my face somehow, because Bif then said &ldquo;Aw, missing your <em>boyfriend</em>?&rdquo; right before the second bell to actually begin the round. </p>
<p  >I couldn&rsquo;t move&mdash;I was too busy staring at him with pure loathing. I managed to grind out &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know <em>shit</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I forced myself to <em>move</em> already, dodging another jab even as a memory of Gary looking at me with a frighteningly unquenchable thirst lodged itself in the forefront of my mind. I only narrowly managed to avoid the hit, which seemed to raise Bif&rsquo;s spirits. Clearly he thought he had the key to victory. &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;ll bet you wanted his money. Started playing gold digger?&rdquo; He shrugged as I felt my entire body start to vibrate. Only the barest sliver of reason was keeping me from trying to tear this asshole apart. </p>
<p  >I yelled &ldquo;SHUT. UP!&rdquo; and punctuated the words with two jabs that <em>finally</em> met their mark. Who does this douche think he is, talking like he <em>knows</em> me? Like he knows <em>Gary</em>!? </p>
<p  >Bif grunted, recovering from my surprise hits, but he swung at me and connected again. Honestly though, I was beyond caring at this point; I just took the punch so I could swipe again. I swore to myself when Bif evaded them. He continued conversationally &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s too bad that he&rsquo;s gone, a loser like you could really use somebody like him&mdash;&rdquo; He shrugged, adding something more that I couldn&rsquo;t hear. </p>
<p  >I shook my head; Gary calling me &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo; so many times that it had actually started to sound like a <em>compliment</em> reverberated through my head. I glared daggers at Bif and muttered &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t <em>fucking</em> know him&rdquo; as I took various swings at him, each more vicious than the last. But my punching had become nothing more than unorganized flailing that Bif was easily able to block or dodge. Crap! I stepped away, forcing myself to take a deep breath. I reminded myself of all the training I&rsquo;d gone through with Jimmy, and squeezed the rage that was pulsing through my veins into the framework of boxing&mdash;read your opponent, wait until they&rsquo;re open, and hit as hard as you can. I re-joined the fight, using this newfound laser-focus to dodge multiple jabs. I <em>finally</em> found an opening, and started just fucking wailing on him, letting the memory of feeling utterly powerless as I watched my only friend waste away before my eyes wash through me. I sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t powerless <em>now</em>. As he staggered back, I squeezed my eyes shut as some of the more graphic memories resurfaced, making me retch a little. I forced my eyes back open, saw he was about to take a swing&mdash;but he&rsquo;d left himself open, and a mental image of Gary&rsquo;s face smeared with blood and gleeful anticipation as he was about to attack Jimmy sent my blood boiling. I couldn&rsquo;t care less about being hit myself by this point; all I could see was red, and I wanted somebody <em>hurt</em>. At some point, though, I registered that Bif wasn&rsquo;t fighting back&mdash;he&rsquo;d fallen down, and wasn&rsquo;t getting back up. </p>
<p  >I blinked, backing away as the bile rose in my throat&mdash;my adrenaline rush slowly died down, allowing the sound of outraged Preppies and an enthusiastically hollering Jimmy to reach my ears. Even so, they sounded muffled and far away. The rage had come on so fast I was still reeling&mdash;my skin was crawling again, and I was having trouble breathing. I scrabbled to get the boxing gloves off, throwing them away as far as I could, and pressing both palms into my eyes. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what was stronger, the need to sob until I couldn&rsquo;t breathe or the need to throw up whatever I&rsquo;d eaten that morning. Either way, my throat was so closed up that I couldn&rsquo;t do anything but tremble as the crash set in. </p>
<p  >Gary. Gary, <em>Gary</em>, <em>GARY</em>! It feels like he&rsquo;s all I ever think about! My knees gave way and I collapsed gracelessly onto the mat, my body apparently deciding that crying would be more appropriate for the moment. For fuck&rsquo;s sake, why do I have to <em>feel</em> this way? A memory of Gary stroking me immediately made my throat fill with bile and forced out a sob. I hadn&rsquo;t liked any of that! Then why was I so <em>angry</em> when Bif had said that shit about Gary? Why do I care about him even with everything he&rsquo;s fucking done!? </p>
<p  >I shifted to sitting on my butt, and wrapped my hands around my knees as I took some deep breaths to quiet the sobs a little. <em>Why</em> did I need to feel this shitty? I considered some more memories&mdash;one of that first night, when Gary had stabbed the table to avoid discussing his motivations; another of Gary promising he was just going to make me feel really, really good as he rubbed my penis; Gary staring at me for hours while I doodled, his expression resigned; Gary kissing me in the dark and whispering &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; in my ear over and over again after a handjob; I shuddered. In disgust, partly, but all those memories made me feel more than just gross&mdash;they felt so&hellip; intimate, like I&rsquo;d taken something without him even realizing it. </p>
<p  >As I took more shuddering breaths to calm myself, I felt somebody rubbing circles on my back. <em>Jimmy</em>. He wasn&rsquo;t saying anything, but I felt better just knowing he was there. <em>I got your back.</em> I uncurled myself, wiping my eyes and nose with the back of my hand. Turning to Jimmy, I had to explain. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; my throat closed up, but I just waited for it to open back up. &ldquo;I hate feeling this way&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy nodded, still rubbing my back as he looked at me with empathy. &ldquo;I know, man. Ya just gotta work through it,&rdquo; I was suddenly aware of a great deal of muttering behind me, which caused Jimmy to glare over his shoulder. &ldquo;Hey, why don&rsquo;t ya&rsquo;ll piss off, huh? Give your new champ some respect!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snickered softly as the Preps responded with customary prickly hostility. Raising both hands to cover my eyes, I realized something; <em>I don&rsquo;t have to be angry with him.</em> Moving so my hands were supporting my own weight as Jimmy got up and started a shouting match with the others in the room, I realized I wanted to <em>forgive</em> Gary. I frowned, memories of the sex stuff returning. But&hellip; I recalled the anger from earlier, my grip on the mat tightening. <em>Forgiving him would be so much easier than staying angry with him</em>&hellip; </p>
<p  >But an authoritative voice broke me out of my contemplation. &ldquo;You <em>disgust</em> me!&rdquo; I looked up to see Derby looking at Bif like he was some dog shit stuck to the bottom of his shoe. </p>
<p  >But before he could get another word in, Jimmy cut in with &ldquo;Yeah, right back at&rsquo;chya, fuckface!&rdquo; I saw Derby&rsquo;s eyes widen in shock before he started glaring at Jimmy. I couldn&rsquo;t see his face from this angle, but Jimmy&rsquo;s stance was very relaxed. He <em>had</em> beaten these guys four times by now, after all&mdash;he had plenty of reason to be cocky. </p>
<p  >Darby sneered his next comment directly at Jimmy. &ldquo;It takes more than victory to become a champion, <em>gutter-snipe</em>,&rdquo; Turning around, he addressed his fellows with what probably counted for a rousing speech as I started pushing myself back to my feet. &ldquo;It takes breeding, and nepotism, and snobbery&mdash;&rdquo; Turning back to Jimmy, he spat &ldquo;Things I&rsquo;m sure some food-stamp <strong>bastard</strong> like <em>you</em> could never understand,&rdquo; I grimaced, looking at Jimmy carefully. Stuff about his family was a huge sore spot for him. I put a hand on his shoulder questioningly as he cracked his knuckles. He nodded a little in my direction at the contact, a silent <em>thanks for the support</em> as Derby continued getting the Preps riled up. I was just relieved Jimmy was okay. &ldquo;Gentlemen, are we going to let some middle-class nobody come in and beat up our friend, Bif?&rdquo; I flinched, looking down at Bif. Yeesh&hellip; I really did beat him up&hellip; He was coughing as he pushed himself up to his hands and knees, and I felt the sour sensation of guilt in my gut. Sheesh, I didn&rsquo;t even know I <em>could</em> hurt people like that. </p>
<p  >I shook my head as I walked up to the boxer, ignoring the chorus of &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; in the background from the small number of Preps. It wasn&rsquo;t fair for me to win because of such a fluke; he couldn&rsquo;t have known that Gary was such a sore spot for me. Looking at the pain I&rsquo;d caused, I didn&rsquo;t really care about winning anymore, anyway. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Then what are we going to do!?&rdquo; As Derby kept talking, I crouched down next to Bif, who glared at me. But before he said anything, I extended a hand to him, trying to give him a warm smile. Plus, I really should have been more mature in responding to the taunting. </p>
<p  >The loud cries of &ldquo;Beat him back to the subdivision!&rdquo; kind of undermined my attempt at being non-threatening, but oh well. </p>
<p  >Jimmy cut through the cacophony of &lsquo;YEAH!&rsquo;s as he vaulted over the edge of the ring, shouting &ldquo;Hey, you wanna get to him, you gotta go through <em>me</em> first, blue-bitches!&rdquo; That got Bif&rsquo;s attention, and he began trying to push himself back to his feet. </p>
<p  >I put a hand on his shoulder to keep him from moving too much. &ldquo;Whoa, hey, it&rsquo;s okay&mdash;are you alright?&rdquo; I scanned the other kid&rsquo;s face for any signs of a serious injury, worrying my lip; I couldn&rsquo;t recall feeling any crunches or snaps, but the seconds-long round was a blur in my memory&mdash;it had felt like minutes to me, so I didn&rsquo;t trust myself to remember. </p>
<p  >Bif glanced back at me, the confusion returning for a moment before shifting to anger. He sneered &ldquo;What do <em>you</em> want, loser?&rdquo; It sounded like he wanted to continue, but he was interrupted by some coughing. </p>
<p  >Rolling my eyes at the irony of using the term &lsquo;loser&rsquo; in this case, I replied &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I mean, I was just checking to make sure you&rsquo;re not hurt.&rdquo; Seemed like he was okay&mdash;he was moving his limbs and face alright. I rubbed an arm awkwardly and moved to sit next to him, adding &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry I went off on you, I shouldn&rsquo;t have lost my head like that,&rdquo; I stared blankly at the mat, recalling the surge of anger at what the boxer had said about Gary&mdash;it was like he was assuming he knew Gary, when he so obviously <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> know him. I frowned. But&hellip; why does that bother me so much? </p>
<p  >A loud laugh from my left broke me out of my thoughts and drew my attention back to Bif. The other teenager gave me a superior look as he sneered &ldquo;Are you seriously <em>apologizing</em> for fighting me?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d finally stopped coughing enough to be able to shift off his knees and sit down. </p>
<p  >I laughed a little, shrugging. &ldquo;Yeah, I suppose I am!&rdquo; I sighed, adding &ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve been more mature and ignored what you were saying.&rdquo; I smiled more genuinely as a bit of relief sprung up in my chest. I don&rsquo;t know Bif very well, so it wasn&rsquo;t like I was crying tears of joy or anything, but it made me feel a little better after the dark place my thoughts had gone during the fight. &ldquo;Hey, want some water?&rdquo; I got up before he answered. I wanted something to drink anyway, I pretty thirsty. </p>
<p  >Bif sounded confused when he replied automatically &ldquo;Um, sure?&rdquo; Luckily, he didn&rsquo;t sound hostile anymore. As I walked over to the corner of the ring where Jimmy had set my water, the sounds of fighting drifted down from the bar upstairs. I sighed. It&rsquo;s like they didn&rsquo;t even see me apologize to Bif. I swear, the people in this town are freakin&rsquo; crazy. Picking up the water, I gulped some down as I moved back to where the other boy was before holding it out questioningly as I sat down. &ldquo;&hellip;thanks?&rdquo; Bif accepted the water, moving to lift the bottle directly to his mouth before stopping and looking from the bottle to me and back. Instead he poured the water into his mouth without touching it to his lips. I had to suppress an eye-roll; seriously? Do poor people have cooties now or something? When he was done, he looked all around the room as he fiddled with the bottle before meeting my eyes, saying &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m&hellip; uh, sorry for saying that stuff.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I started&mdash;that had been the last thing I&rsquo;d expected&mdash;before waving a hand dismissively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, man.&rdquo; I sighed, adding &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have known how&hellip; um, sensitive a topic that is for me.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >After that we sat in relative silence for a while, just listening to the sounds of continued fighting. I could hear the &lsquo;twang&rsquo; of a slingshot coupled with some muffled cackling and taunts. It sounded like Jimmy was just dragging it out. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get why he likes fighting and violence so much. &ldquo;Yeah, I can&rsquo;t believe Smith is into guys!&rdquo; I started a bit, snapping my gaze to Bif, who looked a bit pensive before shrugging, looking at me a bit awkwardly. &ldquo;Who knew, ehh?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I closed my eyes, choosing my words carefully. &ldquo;Look; if you know <em>anything</em> about me, know that I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> in any kind of relationship with Gary,&rdquo; But even as I said it, I flashed on other memories. Meeting Gary at the &lsquo;beginning&rsquo; of the year where he&rsquo;d given me the stupid nick-name; the way his face had lit up when I thanked him for buying me a sketchbook and high-end drawing supplies; that one time he&rsquo;d shown up at my house for Halloween completely uninvited one year and dragged me out trick-or-treating despite my fear of actually seeing and interacting with other kids from town; how relaxed he&rsquo;d been explaining freaking black holes to me. He definitely isn&rsquo;t just some around-town acquaintance like he had been before&mdash;but he&rsquo;s certainly not a friend either&hellip; Hell, I hadn&rsquo;t even <em>seen</em> Gary for a couple of years. The only inkling Jimmy and I had that he wasn&rsquo;t dead was that the team hired to search for him was constantly seeing him in security footage in various locales, but they never seemed to be able to actually find him. </p>
<p  >Bif laughed derisively, saying &ldquo;I know, right? That guy is a <em>real</em> weirdo,&rdquo; I snorted at that; man was <em>that</em> ever true! &ldquo;Haha, yeah. This one time, my parents made me go over to his house or something and he legit wouldn&rsquo;t even talk to me; just said something about &lsquo;refusing to lower his IQ&rsquo;,&rdquo; I laughed despite myself&mdash;that was Gary, all right! Bif looked pretty relaxed, shrugging as he added &ldquo;My father says the Smiths are having a public-relations <em>nightmare</em> trying to find him,&rdquo; He scratched his arm absently, adding &ldquo;Wonder what happened to him, anyway?&rdquo; I shrugged; I&rsquo;d considered the question myself, but I honestly haven&rsquo;t the foggiest. He&rsquo;d left so abruptly that Jimmy and I had just shrugged our shoulders and been happy he was gone&mdash;but that had been, like, three or four yea&ndash;er, loops ago. It was getting a little weird. </p>
<p  >Our impromptu gab sesh was interrupted when the door to the bar upstairs slammed open, and Jimmy shouted &ldquo;&lsquo;Ey yo Pete! Ya still around?&rdquo; He spotting me waving from the railing, and added &ldquo;Cool&rdquo; as he walked over to the staircase. He grinned, saying slyly &ldquo;So ya wanna go vandalize a Prep&rsquo;s house or somethin&rsquo; to celebrate?&rdquo; I saw Bif scowl at that, clearly ready to shout an insult at him, but I held a hand out in a &lsquo;hold on&rsquo; gesture as I pushed myself to a standing position. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Okay, one; you know I don&rsquo;t like doing douchey stuff like that, so it&rsquo;d hardly be a celebration for me,&rdquo; I offered to help Bif get up as I talked. &ldquo;Second&mdash;&rdquo; here I had to stop to try and yank the other boy off the ground. He was<em> heavy</em> &ldquo;&mdash;you don&rsquo;t seriously think that was a fair win, do you Jimmy?&rdquo; I turned to give my friend a patronizing look as he descended the stairs, at which point he finally spotted who I was with. </p>
<p  >When he did, he snorted. &ldquo;Hey, douchey-bags,&rdquo; Looking between the two of us for a moment, he rolled his eyes as I walked over toward him, ducking to go under the ropes and sliding off the edge of the ring-slash-platform. &ldquo;Lemmie guess, you&rsquo;re <em>friends</em> with this guy now.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snorted&mdash;he said that like it was a <em>bad</em> thing! &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s not up to me,&rdquo; Bif vaulted over the rope, landing heavily right behind me. I crossed my arms and gave Jimmy a <em>play nice</em> warning glance before adding &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t answer my question; was that a fair win?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy was about to reply but Bif beat him to it. &ldquo;Hey what happened? Where&rsquo;re my friends?&rdquo; I cringed a little in sympathy. </p>
<p  >Jimmy snorted. &ldquo;Upstairs, licking their wounds, I bet; beat the shit outta &lsquo;em,&rdquo; He threw Bif a threatening glare, adding &ldquo;<em>Nobody</em> fucks with my friends&mdash;got it, trust-fund baby?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >The boxer stepped closer so that he towered over Jimmy, growling &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <em>my</em> line, ghetto-trash!&rdquo; Guess maturity was in short supply today. </p>
<p  >I stepped between them, lightly pushing them apart as I changed the topic &ldquo;Hold on, before you guys beat the shit out of each other&mdash;&rdquo; I paused, making sure I had their attention. &ldquo;&mdash;can we at least deal with who&rsquo;s got the boxing championship title&hellip; thing?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy sighed, stepping back. Bif started, then began glaring at me. &ldquo;What&rsquo;dya <em>mean</em> who&rsquo;s got it? You tryin&rsquo; to make <em>fun</em> of me, loser?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Sheesh&hellip; are all rich people as quick to jump to conclusions as Gary? I held my hands up in a placating manner. &ldquo;No, not at all! I&rsquo;m trying to say that I don&rsquo;t think that was a fair fight, so you should stay the champion,&rdquo; I sighed, looking sidelong in Jimmy&rsquo;s direction pointedly. &ldquo;Of course, we <em>could</em> have discussed this with the people who run the gym and, by extension, the tournament, if they weren&rsquo;t unconscious on the floor upstairs.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >But Jimmy either didn&rsquo;t hear my annoyance or didn&rsquo;t care. He shifted so he was looking me more directly in the eye, his mouth hanging open. &ldquo;Pete, are you serious? You&rsquo;ve been working to do this for <em>a year and a half</em>, and now you&rsquo;re just gonna throw it away!?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I sighed. He was kind of right, but I&rsquo;d known what I was doing when I started out. &ldquo;Come on, Jimmy, I wasn&rsquo;t doing this for a title or anything&mdash;I wanted to deal with my feelings about Gary!&rdquo; I shrugged, adding &ldquo;And hey! I accomplished that&mdash;I don&rsquo;t need a metal for that.&rdquo; I considered that Jimmy groaned in frustration, slapping himself in the face. I muttered mostly to myself &ldquo;Do you even get metals in boxing?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Meanwhile, Bif was looking at me in confusion. He now interjected with &ldquo;Wait, start over&mdash;you don&rsquo;t want to be champion?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shrugged. &ldquo;Whether or not I want to, the match we just had wasn&rsquo;t fair, so it can&rsquo;t count anyway, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Bif&rsquo;s mouth was gaping, and letting out an elongated &ldquo;uhhhhhh&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >But Jimmy cut in again, sighing as he said &ldquo;Man, whatever&mdash;go get changed or something; guess we can go see a movie to celebrate not fuckin&rsquo; winning anything.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I immediately brightened at that, clapping my hands excitedly as I headed in the direction of the locker room. &ldquo;Oooh, can we see <em>Meet the Robinsons</em>? And before you say no, I&rsquo;d like to point out that technically, <em>you</em> were the one who mentioned Gary in the first place,&rdquo; I glanced over my shoulder at Jimmy, grinning cheekily at the grudging guilt. I guess Gary is kind of rubbing off on me. I decided immediately to never voice that thought out loud. </p>
<p  >Jimmy sighed as I made my way to the locker room. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <em>cruel</em>, man. You know I don&rsquo;t wanna see some fuckin&rsquo; kiddie movie.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes, turning around and throwing Jimmy a couple of finger guns as I walked into the locker room. &ldquo;Should&rsquo;a thought of <em>that</em> before bringing up the sexual trauma!&rdquo; I only heard Jimmy groan&mdash;he hates it when I&rsquo;m so blas&eacute; about the whole thing. Peeling my shirt off, I headed over to my locker, smiling to myself at how only Jimmy could be <em>too</em> loyal. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Um.&rdquo; I started, turning back to find Bif looking at me in shock. I cringed&hellip; I&rsquo;d forgotten he was even there. &ldquo;What was&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I cut him off, shaking a hand frantically as I apologized. &ldquo;Oh man, I&rsquo;m sorry dude, I didn&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;I just, I um&hellip; I forgot you were here&hellip;&rdquo; I trailed off a little pathetically as we stood, half-naked in my case, quietly inhaling the rich scent of body odor that infused the place. </p>
<p  >Bif shuffled his feet before asking &ldquo;Is it something about, uh, the Smith kid?&rdquo; I sighed, but nodded. It&rsquo;s a good thing nobody caught on a couple loops ago&hellip; I would&rsquo;ve never been able to talk about it. </p>
<p  >I grabbed my gym bag and stuffed my now-sweaty shirt in it, getting the rest of my clothing off so I could shower. &ldquo;Yeah, it is. He&hellip; did some stuff to me a while ago,&rdquo; Looking up at Bif&rsquo;s horrified face, I shrugged as I grabbed my toiletries bag. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m doing better,&rdquo; As I made my way over to the showers, I didn&rsquo;t really like the feeling of Bif staring at my back. I&rsquo;ve never liked the idea of extra attention. </p>
<p  >I could hear Bif come closer to my shower stall even after closing the curtain. &ldquo;But I&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; Turning on the water, I rolled my eyes. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Well yeah, &lsquo;course you didn&rsquo;t&mdash;I hardly even knew you before today, after all,&rdquo; That wasn&rsquo;t, strictly speaking, true; I probably knew Bif a little better than the other boy knew me, what with the time-travel and all. Still, best to try and make him feel a little better. </p>
<p  >The next few minutes were spent with only the sound of running water. Eventually, though, Bif spoke up again as I was pulling my clean change of clothes on. &ldquo;Hey, were&hellip; were you invited to Smith&rsquo;s birthday that one time?&rdquo; I looked back up at him as I dried my hair, surprised at the question. </p>
<p  >Then, considering his words, I frowned. &ldquo;Um. Well&hellip; which one?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Bif shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, the one where he disappeared halfway through the party and stole all the goodie bags when they tried to let everybody leave.&rdquo; his face was sporting a rather peeved expression when he pulled the towel away. &ldquo;That was the only reason I&rsquo;d even <em>agreed</em> to go to that stupid party&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I laughed, the memory coming back to me. &ldquo;Oh yeah! Haha, I remember that!&rdquo; At some point, the two of us had ended up under a bush in Gary&rsquo;s yard eating pb&amp;j and cake as he complained about how his parents hadn&rsquo;t let him only invite me. &lsquo;So I had to invite <em>all</em> my mum and pa&rsquo;s stupid friends&rsquo; kids.&rsquo; He scowled as he bit a sandwich, glaring at them through the bush. I had shrugged, adding &lsquo;Well, I had fun!&rsquo; Gary had turned to me, his eyes (no scar at the time) lighting up as he grinned mischievously. &lsquo;Worth it, then!&rsquo; &ldquo;Yeah, Gary was pretty angry about having to invite more people than he wanted,&rdquo; I smiled sadly at the memory. That must&rsquo;ve been before Gary got trapped in the loops&hellip; I buttoned up my shirt, frowning. Not for the first time, I shivered at trying to imagine re-living the same period of time for centuries. Having lived through a few loops myself I probably had a better grasp of the concept than most, but the sheer <em>scale</em> of what Gary must&rsquo;ve gone through was&hellip; well, horrifying. </p>
<p  >Bif made a rather awkward &lsquo;I heard what you said just now but I don&rsquo;t really know what to say in response&rsquo; &ldquo;Hm, really?&rdquo; and started getting dressed himself. I&rsquo;m no stranger to social awareness, so I left the boxer to his own devices and returned to my train of thought; forgiving Gary. It was odd how natural it sounded, how <em>easy</em>; like I&rsquo;d been ignoring the obvious solution the whole time. Pulling my pants up, I considered what Jimmy would think of it&mdash;naturally he&rsquo;d object. I sighed; Jimmy never bends when it comes to Gary. It&rsquo;s like if he thinks of Gary as anything other than some one-dimensional evil villain it would be like kicking the shit out of his mother or something. </p>
<p  >&lt;&gt;&nbsp; </p>
<p  >Eventually, Bif and I parted ways, and I went out to find Jimmy. He was, not surprisingly, unhappy with this development. &ldquo;What <em>are</em> you, some fuckin&rsquo; Xiaolin temple monk or something? All &lsquo;one with all&rsquo; and shit?&rdquo; Were his exact words. But I didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;Jimmy could protest all he wanted, but I&rsquo;d made up my mind; I care more about my own sanity than holding a grudge. </p>

<p > &lt;new chapter 6: Gary Alone?&gt; </p>
<p > ~~~~~~~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >Highway underpasses. River banks. Bus stops. Homeless shelters. Locations and faces melted and blurred together into a formless mass as time passed. I had to force myself to eat, to avoid danger, to keep myself out of harm&rsquo;s way. Pe&hellip; he had said not to kill myself, but there was no way to know whether that extended to putting myself into situations knowing it was likely that I would die. It was difficult. Incredibly so. I could go days without any incidents, and then a bunch of boys in their school uniform sweater vests would run past me and it would flood back; his disgusted expressions whenever I decided to push his limits, the fury in his expression when I&rsquo;d talked to him, just&hellip; </p>
<p  >I knew it was pointless to mope, but it was still all I did for the next few loops. What else <em>could</em> I do? Even though the weeks blead into one another and became utterly inseperable in my mind, I felt every minute trickle past at an agonizingly slow crawl. I learned very early in the loops that having a specific project or goal to work on kept the insanity at bay far more effectively than just farting around. Even during the decades before learning of my attraction to Petey where I simply pretended to be a normal teenager, I spent all the rest of my time reading and working on my classes&mdash;by the end of that fourty-year stretch I&rsquo;d read every single book I could get my hands on in town and would&rsquo;ve been able to graduate before the school year was out, had they actually let me simply submit every possible assignment whenever I wanted instead of insisting on only accepting my work if it had been done after it&rsquo;d been assigned. Jimmy had been outraged at this, mostly because I hadn&rsquo;t given him any copies of my work. Petey had, after a large number of questions, had also been outraged, though more on my behalf than in Jimmy&rsquo;s case. </p>
<p  >And <em>that</em> was why I needed to stay far, far away from Bullworth. I couldn&rsquo;t stay anywhere for long, and giving in and letting myself be taken back to Bullworth was such a tempting option that I had to always remember Petey to keep from doing it. A couple of loops I even employed more drastic measures and managed to get myself out of the country with no means of return! Unfortunately, it ended up not being enough. </p>
<p  >I&rsquo;d decided to stay in the country this loop around, and being the idiot that I am, somehow found myself slightly close to Bullworth. At this time I decided to pay a visit to a local country club to see if any of the rich people there would have enough pity for a &lsquo;street-Arab&rsquo; to give me some chores to do in exchange for some food or something. While waiting in the lobby, I chanced to glance at the &lsquo;Upcoming Events&rsquo; section in some newspaper. <u>Local Up-and Comer to challenge Bif Taylor for Bullworth championship boxing title! Will Upper-class Class trounce Small Suburban Upstart?</u> It was redulious to think that this had anything to do with Petey. There were dozens of other students in Bullworth alone that could&rsquo;ve given Biff a run for his title if not his money, Jimmy being one of them. There were even those of Petey&rsquo;s more middle-class economic status that could be this &lsquo;Small Suburban Upstart&rsquo;. </p>
<p  >But deep down I knew I&rsquo;d been doomed the moment I glanced at that paper. Maybe it was why I hadn&rsquo;t left the country that time; I felt so lost, like I was surrounded by white fog. And despite catching glimpses of something recognizable in the distance, avoiding Petey felt like I was deliberately trying to run away from that single landmark after spending lifetimes seeking it out. </p>
<p  >So I went back. I told myself I wouldn&rsquo;t stay, and I seriously hoped I was right about that. It was March, a bit later than the time Jimmy would&rsquo;ve beaten the Preps in the &lsquo;default&rsquo; timeline of events, though presumably if Jimmy was already the champion that article wouldn&rsquo;t have appeared. I was a bit surprised to find it more crowded than usual&mdash;apparently this match was highly anticipated. Students from all the cliques were there, even a couple of Greasers, although they looked very nervous. Even a couple of townsfolk were in the crowd gathered in the gym to watch. I squeezed my way to the upper story&mdash;if it was Petey in the ring, he probably wouldn&rsquo;t see me if I was on the upper floor. I felt nearly sick to my stomach as the hubub reached nearly a fever pitch&mdash;then, silence. The crowd parted and the current champion strolled through the path, looking very much relaxed. I held my breath and, sure enough, a few seconds later Petey followed. The angle may have been bad, but I could swear I saw the same relaxed posture in Femme Boy&rsquo;s frame. </p>
<p  >~~~ </p>
<p  >It was a surprisingly tense match. I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes when I saw <em>Petey</em> of all people land a solid flurry of punches in the thick of things&mdash;he even won the second round! Unfortunately, it seemed Bif was just too solid an oponent for him to oppose, and he ultimately lost. But he still shook the champion&rsquo;s hand after, probably thanked him for the match. I could see the beaming smile on his face during the handshake. A surprisngly large portion of the audience was unahppy with the results, as evidenced by the number of &lsquo;boo&rsquo;s eminating from the Greasers, and some of the Jocks joined in, but most just clapped politely. None booed louder than Jimmy, whose shouted protests I could hear just fine. &ldquo;That was fuckin&rsquo; <em>bullshit</em>! Come on, you douchebags saw that shit, right!?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >It took some quiet protests from Petey to calm him down, but by then the other students booing had taken up the chant. A couple of Bullies standing next to me took up the chant as well, presumably just reveling in the chaos. I kept my eyes on Petey, though. He seemed&hellip; annoyed? exasperated? with what was going on, but as the crowd got rowdier, he went over to the corner where the moron had been watching and rummaged around before pulling something out that he proceeded to shake and hold out to the sky before <strong>BWAAAAAAAAP</strong>! </p>
<p  >He then cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted, &ldquo;CAN EVERYBODY SHUT UP FOR A SECOND AND LET ME TALK!?&rdquo; In the momentary silence, he nodded. &ldquo;Great! I just wanted to thank everybody for coming today. I also have to thank Bif,&rdquo; he inclined his head toward the beheamoth in the corner of the ring before returning his gaze to the crowd, &ldquo;For agreeing to do this whole thing on unofficial terms! Hooray!&rdquo; He started clapping, and soon the crowd got the hint and joined in. As the applause died down, he said, &ldquo;Without which non-members of the gym wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to come, and that would&rsquo;ve sucked. Also put your hands together for&nbsp; ~~~ Then he saw me. We locked eyes and I saw his go wide as he stumbled with what he was saying. For a moment, I couldn&rsquo;t help but drink his eyes in&mdash;crap! I quickly flipped my hood up and retreated into the crowd. My heart was racing, but he quickly got back on track, so he probably hadn&rsquo;t recognized me. </p>
<p  >Still, better safe than sorry. </p>
<p  >~~~ </p>
<p  >I sighed to myself, watching the water splash against the window. Being alone when one of these episodes hit isn&rsquo;t ideal, but there wasn&rsquo;t much I could do about it now. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your problem now, jackass?&rdquo; Some weirdo that had decided to &lsquo;take me in&rsquo; or some such was following me around these days. I couldn&rsquo;t even tell whether this person was a girl or a guy, and insisted on people using &lsquo;they&rsquo; when talking about &lsquo;them&rsquo;. They plopped down next to me, blowing a gust of cigarette smoke into my face. When I didn&rsquo;t respond, they sighed. &ldquo;Yeesh, kid. You&rsquo;re hella self-involved; can&rsquo;t you even just give a hint about what this is all about?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >It was true, I had a feeling that most people in this encampment suspected I was actually mute I talked so little these days. I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to just get it all out. Sighing, I said musingly, &ldquo;Mm. I&rsquo;m trying to resist the temptation to kill myself. But this living day-to-day crap keeps getting in the way of seeing him. So, getting harder to stop.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >A few moments later I heard an uncertain, &ldquo;Oh. Uh, shit. Wow, that&rsquo;s&hellip; uh. Yeah.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Flicking my gaze to the cigarette, I added, &ldquo;Yes, you might say it&rsquo;s &lsquo;hella shitty&rsquo;.&rdquo; &nbsp; </p>
<p  >&nbsp; </p>
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 7&lt;maybe absorb into Zuko Alone?&gt;: Congratulations, Your Pete has Leveled Up!~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >&lt;indicate the weather &amp; time of year&gt; </p>
<p  >The sun was setting over the campus, lighting up the town beyond so that it was almost beautiful. The construction scaffolding creaked as I rocked my leg back and forth. I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of sitting around and thinking lately&mdash;right now I was trying to remember the very first time I came up here. I only got pieces: the rain, Jimmy yelling, and the fall&hellip; that was it. I remember feeling the electricity in the air from the storm, and how ecstatic I&rsquo;d been about winning, and the terror of the fall. Sure, I know line-for-line some of the things that were said, but only because I forced myself to repeat it later. They&rsquo;ve faded from my memory by now. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Geez, you sure found a good rock to climb under!&rdquo; I snapped my eyes open and looked over to see Petey sitting down cross-legged next to me. He was still wearing that dopey boxing outfit, too. He continued &ldquo;I searched for you all over town after you left, but couldn&rsquo;t find you.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t respond. He didn&rsquo;t want me to talk to him, I knew that much. He didn&rsquo;t talk again for a while. Eventually he said &ldquo;...So&hellip; what&rsquo;djya think?&rdquo; I glanced over at him and he was smiling in this slightly-bashful-but-also-confident way that only this new Petey can pull off. &ldquo;I thought I did pretty good to reach the final round, even if I didn&rsquo;t get the championship,&rdquo; I nodded. He really <em>had</em> done well. Part of me still couldn&rsquo;t wrap my brain around little <em>Femme Boy</em> even taking a boxing class, much less entering a tournament. Petey smiled at my nod, returning to admiring the view. &ldquo;Haha, yeah.&rdquo; He sighed, and didn&rsquo;t speak for a few minutes before adding tentatively &ldquo;So&hellip; we haven&rsquo;t seen you in a while.&rdquo; My eyes were closed but I would&rsquo;ve bet <em>anything</em> that he was glancing at me. &ldquo;Have you been doing okay?&rdquo; Ha! Oh yeah, I&rsquo;ve been doing  <em> fine </em>  trying to reverse centuries worth of engrained behavior. </p>
<p  >I didn&rsquo;t say that, though. What I did say was &ldquo;You know the first thing I ever remember?&rdquo; And I opened my eyes  , gazing down at the school campus below  .   I saw   Petey glance at me   out of the corner of my eye  , and sh  a  k  e   his head. I let out a breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a memory of your hand, with the tendons and bones exposed.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >After a moment I heard him gasp. &ldquo;Oh shit, I remember that too! I still have the scar&hellip;&rdquo; He lifted his hand to scan the back, as if he didn&rsquo;t already know what it looked like. I couldn&rsquo;t see   the scar tissue I knew was there  , but then I hadn&rsquo;t seen him for a few years. He was more muscular than he had been&mdash;the Petey I&rsquo;d known never looked like he could pick up more than a couple of textbooks; he was visibly stronger. The light played off his skin beautifully, and I flashed on the very first time I&rsquo;d kissed him. God, I had missed him so much&mdash;I shook my head and turned back to the landscape&mdash;didn&rsquo;t want him to think I was staring, which I <em>was</em>, but oh well. He continued talking. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t <em>you</em> push me off the slide that day?&rdquo; I was relieved to find that he was smiling a little. </p>
<p  >I shrugged. &ldquo;Probably&mdash;I don&rsquo;t remember. I wanted to know if you were a robot or not.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey blinked, then started snickering. &ldquo;Haha, what??&rdquo; It&rsquo;d been a long time since I&rsquo;d heard him laugh. I smiled a little, remembering that day long ago. </p>
<p  >Shrugging, I added &ldquo;I thought everybody except me was a robot, at the time.&rdquo; I only remember remembering my thoughts on this, but I can vividly recall the strange relief that had flooded my system when I saw the gore of his hand. &ldquo;Seeing the bone proved that you weren&rsquo;t just covered in a thin layer of skin with circuitry underneath.&rdquo; My poor six-year old self had been elated that I wasn&rsquo;t alone in the world anymore. I smirked; if I&rsquo;d only known. Petey gave kind of a &lsquo;fair enough&rsquo; laugh, turning back to face the sunset. I let the silence hang for a bit before asking the question that had been burning in my mind for the past few loops. &ldquo;Do you hate me?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey gave me a look of what looked like pity, but the way he sighed and pulled his legs in closer to himself belied something a little darker. &ldquo;I did. For a long time.&rdquo; What the hell did he mean by &lsquo;a long time&rsquo;? It&rsquo;d only been five loops. He took a deep breath before continuing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have nightmares, or flashbacks during class&hellip; and I would get so <em>angry</em> at people, for the smallest things.&rdquo; He laughed a little, adding &ldquo;You know one time Jimmy had to pull me off one of the Jocks? He&rsquo;d said something about me being a faggot&hellip; and something just&hellip; <em>snapped</em> and I couldn&rsquo;t think about anything except hurting him.&rdquo; I nodded, although I internally couldn't even imagine little Petey attacking somebody. He sighed, adding absently &ldquo;That was when Jimmy suggested I take up boxing.&rdquo; I turned away at that&mdash;any mention of the moron still turns my stomach. And what really burns me up is how Jimmy had probably had more to do with helping Petey than I ever could. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;So then why aren&rsquo;t you using that skill on me, hm?&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t even meant for either of them to see me at the match, I&rsquo;d just heard about it from some passing Preppie conversation and literally could not stop myself from going. </p>
<p  >He gave a short laugh. &ldquo;For one thing, hating you was <em>really</em> exhausting. I guess part of the reason it&hellip; hurt so much was because, well, I did consider you a friend, kind of.&rdquo; I squeezed my eyes shut. Of <em>course</em>. Such a Femme Boy thing to think. He continued, sounding more pensive now. &ldquo;And you just seemed&hellip; so, I dunno, messed up. A part of me couldn&rsquo;t hold it against you because you clearly weren&rsquo;t in your right mind, you know?&rdquo; What could I say? I know I don&rsquo;t deserve that kind of consideration, especially considering the stuff in all the <em>other</em> loops that I&rsquo;d done to him. </p>
<p  >Hm. Come to think of it&hellip; I opened my eyes and turned to face Petey. Let&rsquo;s see what he thought of some of the worst stuff I&rsquo;d ever done. &ldquo;Do you remember when I said that I wasn&rsquo;t threatening to torture you because it wouldn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo; He frowned, nodding. &ldquo;Well, do you know how I knew that, Femme Boy?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He averted his gaze for a moment, saying hesitantly &ldquo;No, but&hellip; I can probably guess.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I wasn&rsquo;t done yet, though. &ldquo;And what about when you asked me how many times I&rsquo;d killed the two of you?&rdquo; He stiffened at that, nodding silently. &ldquo;Well. You know how many times I&rsquo;ve killed <em>you</em>  ?  &rdquo; I held his gaze&mdash;I had to make him understand how stupid he was being. &ldquo;Once.&rdquo; I felt the memory come rushing back&mdash;<em>the warmth of the liquid had been what woke me up,&lt;&gt; but the smell was what made me snap my eyes open a couple of seconds later. &ldquo;&hellip;Petey?&rdquo;</em>&mdash;&ldquo;I held a knife to your throat and <em>made</em> you do whatever I wanted. And I <em>liked</em> it, too.&rdquo; We stayed looking at each other for a few seconds. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;So&hellip; what, then you killed me?&rdquo; He frowned, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to be out of anger, more out of confusion. </p>
<p  >I replied without thinking about it. &ldquo;What? No, you&hellip;&rdquo; My throat closed up&mdash;<em>I was running, I had to find somebody, there! A prefect! &ldquo;Hey, help! He&rsquo;s not bre-&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop right there! Is that blood!?&rdquo;</em>&mdash;&ldquo;&hellip;You were dead when I woke up&hellip;&rdquo;&mdash;<em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not MINE! Go help HIM!&rdquo; Oh God it&rsquo;s his blood it&rsquo;s everywhere he&rsquo;s dead he&rsquo;s dead no no no nononononoNONONONO&ndash;</em> </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Gary?&rdquo; And suddenly I was back. I&rsquo;ll never understand how he does that; he&rsquo;d even laid a hand on my shoulder. I moved away, breaking the contact. He sighed. &ldquo;Gary, I underst&mdash;  no.  &rdquo; He shook his head before trying to re-establish eye-contact with me. I was impressed that I resisted the urge to lock eyes with him, instead fixing my gaze on City Hall in the distance. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, <em>can&rsquo;t</em> understand, but I know that you&rsquo;ve done horrible things.&rdquo; I snorted. He was one of three people who understood better than anyone the extent of what I&rsquo;d done. Petey continued anyway. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t care, because I forgive you.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;I mean, for the stuff you did to <em>me</em>, specifically. That I remember. I can&rsquo;t speak for any other&hellip;   um. Mes.  &rdquo; I gave in and just stared at him. &ldquo;So&hellip;   come on, let  &rsquo;s head back to the dorm.&rdquo; He got onto his knee before standing fully, holding out a hand while he asked &ldquo;You probably haven&rsquo;t been sleeping too well, huh?&rdquo; I flashed on one of the very first loops&mdash;Petey kneeling down and asking if I needed help. </p>
<p  >I accepted his hand automatically. </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p  >I exhaled sharply. Petey had just gone into his&mdash;well, <em>our</em>, I guess&mdash;room to go to bed. I&rsquo;d refused, claimed I wasn&rsquo;t tired. God knows I don&rsquo;t trust myself to sleep in the same room as him. I leaned against the wall next to the door, unsure of what to do now. &ldquo;So it really <em>was</em> you an&rsquo; Pete talkin&rsquo; earlier.&rdquo; I raised my head to see the moron glaring at me, arms crossed, hostile stance. Well, this was bound to happen sooner or later. Better that it be sooner. </p>
<p  >I pursed my lips. Honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how I felt about Jimmy anymore. The fact that Petey is, apparently, willing to tolerate my presence&hellip; it kind of makes the fact that he&rsquo;ll always like Jimmy more than me bearable. Still, though; that didn&rsquo;t mean I had to like him. &ldquo;Hello, moron. Long time no see.&rdquo; I grinned as I moved past him toward the stairwell. Guess I could sleep on the couch and sneak into the room before Petey woke up tomorrow. Jimmy followed me, not wearing his Murder face, but not quite his Whu-Wat-Duh face either. </p>
<p  >If I had to name it (which I do, because I find it amusing), I&rsquo;d call it the Fuck You face. &ldquo;Yeah. Hoped you&rsquo;d offed yourself again.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;He told me not to.&rdquo; I flinched as I began peeling off my sweater. Revealing incredibly personal things to Petey is something I can&rsquo;t seem to help, but I hardly needed to let Hopkins know more about me than he already did. </p>
<p  >He barked a laugh as we made it to the bottom of the stairwell. &ldquo;Yeah, &lsquo;cuz you give <em>so</em> many shits about what Pete wants.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t bother to ignore how my stomach clenched at that. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Do you have something you want to tell me, or are you just wasting my time and breath?&rdquo; I averted my eyes while unbuttoning my undershirt&mdash;an excellent excuse to not look at him. </p>
<p  >While doing so, I heard an uncharacteristic amount of hesitation in Jimmy&rsquo;s next line, &ldquo;Uh&hellip; what&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo;   We  &rsquo;d reached the common room, and he was looking at me strangely. </p>
<p  >I glared at him as I undid my pants. &ldquo;Getting ready to go to sleep, what&rsquo;s it look like?&rdquo; His intense stare kept me from pulling them fully down, though. What was his problem? </p>
<p  >The moron just raised an eyebrow and shrugged, though. &ldquo;Whatever. Yeah, I got somethin&rsquo; to say to you.&rdquo; Here he put on his Murder face, and moved much closer to me. &ldquo;<em>Do. NOT. Hurt. Pete.</em> You do, and I&rsquo;ll make you <strong>WISH</strong> you could die for real, got it psycho?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I thought about the conversation he and I had just had on the roof&mdash;the sunset lighting the contours of his newly muscular arms as he looked at his hand in wonder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;  t even worry, Jimmy-boy  &mdash;Petey&rsquo;s tougher than you <em>or</em> me.&rdquo; I felt myself smile involuntarily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be just fine.&rdquo; It was true enough&hellip; but of course the moron didn&rsquo;t have the same context that I did. </p>
<p  >He just growled, &ldquo;Whatever, asshole. I don&rsquo;t give a <em>shit</em> if Pete&rsquo;s cool with you&mdash;the word &lsquo;unforgivable&rsquo; exists for a fuckin&rsquo; reason.&rdquo; I laughed a bit at that. That was the most intelligent thing I&rsquo;d heard in a few years! </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Thank God <em>some</em>body around here is thinking rationally.&rdquo; Jimmy frowned, but mostly ignored my comment. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Look, Pete probably wants us to act fuckin&rsquo; civil tomorrow, so don&rsquo;t do anything to piss me off, &lsquo;kay?&rdquo; I nodded, hopping onto the couch and stretching out. What more was there to say? &ldquo;&hellip;  Well?  &rdquo;   I sighed. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yes, I <em>got</em> it; Lay a finger on Petey and I&rsquo;m dead meat. Can I go to bed now?&rdquo; Jimmy just grunted and stalked off. I rolled my eyes. There was the <em>other</em> problem with Petey &lsquo;forgiving&rsquo; me&mdash;now I&rsquo;d have to constantly deal with Jimmy. Well&hellip; I did have to live with him for that one month and I managed to not stab him, who knows what more time could do? Plus, I thought as I closed my eyes, Petey must like him for a reason&hellip; maybe I could figure that out while I was at it. </p>
<p  >&nbsp; </p>





<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 18: What, Are You <em>Scared</em>?~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I rocked back in my chair as the teacher droned on about some math thing or whatever, bored as fuck. Man, I just don&rsquo;t get this kind of stuff&mdash;Pete&rsquo;s not too good at it either, so I basically try and remember what numbers go where on tests as I rack up more repeats. Which pisses him off, because we&rsquo;re supposed to &lsquo;actually learn it&rsquo;, but come on! When the fuck am I ever gonna need <em>algebra</em>? I leaned forward onto my elbows, staring out the window again at the leaves falling off the trees and shit. Gary&rsquo;s probably good at this shit. I snorted to myself&mdash;of <em>course</em> he is, he&rsquo;s good at <em>everything</em>. </p>
<p  >Since Pete &lsquo;forgave&rsquo; the psycho, the two of us got a system going. We don&rsquo;t talk if we don&rsquo;t need to around Pete, and whenever he isn&rsquo;t around we beat each other into the ground. Nice and simple, just like I like it. But Gary&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> better at fighting than he looks. I mean come on, I know I can take him out with just a few good hits! But the guy has a <em>stupid</em> high tolerance for pain, he&rsquo;s way faster than he looks, and I swear, it&rsquo;s like he can read my <em>mind</em>. I shivered, thinking about it as the teacher drew some wiggly lines; not gonna lie, the mind reading creeps me out. He doesn&rsquo;t even bother blocking most of the feints that I throw in, or he dodges sneak-attacks, which is just fucking annoying since it&rsquo;s not like I even use &lsquo;tactics&rsquo; much. Sometimes, he looks almost <em>bored</em>, like he fucking knows exactly what I&rsquo;m gonna do and had seen it a zillion times. That always pisses me off. </p>
<p  >But these days he&rsquo;s looking bored way less, which prob&rsquo;ly means I&rsquo;m getting less &lsquo;predictable&rsquo;. I remembered one day specifically; Gary&rsquo;d looked even more bored than usual as he pinned me to the wall to taunt me about how dumb I am. &ldquo;Haha, you&rsquo;re <em>pathetic</em>, Hopkins!&rdquo; or something like that. Nothing weird about that, but <em>that</em> time, he&rsquo;d had me pinned to a wall and was hissing it right in my ear and <em>fuck</em> it&rsquo;d been sexy. Hot breath blowing on my neck, that bony fucking frame pinning me, just&hellip; dayum! Like, yeah, if I had to pick I&rsquo;d rather Gary was the one getting held down (I mean, I like winning), but I wasn&rsquo;t about to look a gift horse in the mouth, ya know? </p>
<p  >So, I&rsquo;d licked his face. I was aiming for his neck, but being pinned made me kinda, ya know, immobile. Heh, he&rsquo;d loosened his grip at that, you better believe it! I shoved him off and went back to our normal fighting, but the psycho&rsquo;s shocked face stuck with me and gave me <em>ideas</em>.   Every time we fight now I try to do something to get him to lose his cool; grabbing his ass, pinning him and whispering in his ear, hands up his shirt, even licking his neck once! That was <em>glorious</em>&mdash;I swear, Gary had a full-body spasm at that. Must have sensitive skin or something. </p>
<p  >I sighed, remembering the Month of Sexual Frustration that had been that fucking road trip. I haven&rsquo;t seen Gary in years thanks to his disappearing act, but those fantasies hadn&rsquo;t just up and vanished&mdash;I&rsquo;d been trying to, erm&hellip; fill in the gap, I guess, by messing around with pretty much everybody I could. And it was fun, for sure! But having sex with somebody is totally different depending on the person. And fuck, actually being able to force the psycho to his knees! I shivered as I felt the heat pool in my gut at the memories. </p>
<p  >The teacher started yelling at the kid right in front of me while I considered Gary in general. It&rsquo;s kinda weird&mdash;now that I can actually punch him in the face whenever I want, the all-consuming hatred I used to feel kinda lost its steam. I guess. I dunno; I guess it&rsquo;s like how Pete was suuuuper pissed off at Gary in the beginning but when he didn&rsquo;t see him for a while, he kinda&hellip; learned to deal. Heh, maybe groping is just how I deal with being mad. Plus, it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s done anything to Pete. Still, it&rsquo;s a little weird how he really never tries to start   any sexy stuff himself  . He kinda seems to like it while I do it, but it&rsquo;s like he hardly notices after it happens  . Either way he hasn&rsquo;t told me to stop or (God forbid) bitched to Pete about it. Normally I wouldn&rsquo;t do stuff like this to somebody, especially if I didn&rsquo;t know whether or not they&rsquo;re into me&mdash;that shit just isn&rsquo;t okay. But Gary Smith made his bed with what he did, and if he doesn&rsquo;t wanna lie in it, tough shit. I shrugged as everybody started shoving stuff into backpacks; besides, if the psycho wanted me to cut it out, he&rsquo;s welcome to tell me to fuck off. </p>
<p  >The bell to end final period rang and I shot out of my chair. Fucking <em>finally</em>, that class felt like it would never friggin&rsquo; end! I was so fast I ended up bumping into Damon outside the Math classroom. I groaned to myself as I sprinted out of the school, he and his buddy Juri in hot pursuit. It <em>had</em> to be the doucheiest Jock in the whole fuckin&rsquo; school, of course. Even worse, I started <em>panting</em> like a Goddamn fat Nerd or something as I shoved past somebody to get out the door&mdash;stupid fucking <em>resets</em> with the stupid magic bullshit! </p>
<p  >I vaulted over the railing by the Library planning on hoping in the trash can, but grinned when I spotted <em>Gary</em>, of all people. Heh, that was way better! I didn&rsquo;t have much time before the Jocks jumped down here and spotted me, so as I ran I grabbed him by the collar and dragged him over to the corner where the archway and the wall met. Didn&rsquo;t want &lsquo;em to tell it was me, at least&mdash;and knowing those two they&rsquo;d be so grossed out by two guys they wouldn&rsquo;t take a closer look. Gary was too busy trying to keep from falling on his ass to try and get away. Perfect. I finally let go of his shirt when we&rsquo;d reached the wall, let  ting   his taller body hide me. By now he&rsquo;d started bitching about something or other with a couple of &lsquo;moron&rsquo;s thrown in. I just rolled my eyes and yanked his face down into kissing range. That stopped the bitching, at least. I started slow&mdash;who knew when he&rsquo;d last seen any action, after all. Just pressed my lips against his and stuff for the first couple of seconds while I hooked my other hand into his slacks so I could drag him closer. He let out this startled noise, which was just what I needed! I grinned and added tongue to the mix as soon as his mouth opened. I tried not to make it a &lsquo;vying for power&rsquo; thing&mdash;he&rsquo;s probably got a thing for power (and hell, I <em>know</em> I do) but we could explore that later. I massaged his tongue with mine, ran my tongue over his teeth, and teased the <em>fuck</em> outta the roof of his mouth since he shuddered in a way that made me groan and tighten my grip on his neck. Shit if those Jocks found me now I would be fucking <strong>pissed</strong>. I slid the hand I had on his shoulder down to his ass and tugged so his crotch was pressed against my stomach. It was a little awkward, but then he shifted so his knee was <em>right there</em> and fucking <em>hell</em> that was hot! I moaned into his mouth, squeezed his ass even harder, and wrapped my free hand around his neck to bring that mouth closer. </p>
<p  >But.. he was.. really quiet. I&rsquo;d hardly felt any reaction from him since the roof of his mouth thing. I pulled back, scanning him as I took a breath. It didn&rsquo;t even look like he&rsquo;d closed his eyes&mdash;they were wide open, and they looked <em>scared</em>. </p>
<p  >See usually this would be a problem. After all, when you make out with somebody, both of you&rsquo;re supposed to have fun. &hellip;Buuuuut, this is <em>Gary</em>. And it&rsquo;s not like <em>he</em> thinks about shit like &lsquo;consent&rsquo;. Still, though&mdash;I bit my lip as I thought&mdash;fantasizing about holding him down and making him take it up the ass is one thing, but actually doing stuff to him is different. So instead I leaned forward and hissed, &ldquo;  Whassa matter  &mdash;ya <em>scared</em>, psycho?&rdquo; and bit his earlobe a little. It was..  <em> kind </em>  of like asking if he was okay. Maybe. </p>
<p  >Either way, worked; he flinched way more than you&rsquo;d expect from such a light bite. He pushed off the wall and stumbled back, staring at me in utter shock. I just grinned, quickly running my tongue over my upper teeth. If anything, that made him flinch even <em>more</em>! Something kept him rooted to the spot as I gave his ass a nice grope&mdash;wow that&rsquo;s the boniest butt I&rsquo;ve ever felt&mdash;and threw down my skateboard to harass the Jocks. Somebody&rsquo;s gotta teach them not to mess with &lsquo;the new kid&rsquo;, and God knows Pete wasn&rsquo;t gonna do it. As I headed off, I called over my shoulder, &ldquo;Thanks for the help, Gar-bear! Really &lsquo;preciate it!&rdquo; I cackled when he whipped his head after me before he disappeared from view. Damn, talk about satisfying; gettin&rsquo; to make out with somebody I&rsquo;d been lusting after so long had me totally ready to put the smackdown on those fuckin&rsquo; Jocks! </p>
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 19: Welp.~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I took a moment to appreciate the irony of using a church as a place to think about making out with other guys before letting the blind panic wash over me again. What the <em>hell</em> just happened!? I, <em>again</em>, recalled the rush of blood to my groin at the sound of <em>Jimmy FUCKING Hopkins</em> moaning, and how warm and <em>ugh</em> wet his mouth had been, and what was that thing he&rsquo;d even done with the teeth, and why was I so mad at myself for not kissing him back!?! I let my back hit the stone wall of the church, and as I slid down to a sitting position it just made me think of the texture of the wall I&rsquo;d pinned JIMMY GODDAMN HOPKINS to a few minutes ago. </p>
<p  >I took a deep breath&mdash;come on, genius,<em> focus</em>. Plan of action first, then panic. I nodded to myself. Right. So. What was the cause of this&hellip; &lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;attraction&rsquo;&rsquo;&rsquo; to the testicle-brained wonder? </p>
<p  >Perhaps all the sexual stuff he&rsquo;s been doing during our fights had something to do with it. He&rsquo;d started doing things like licking whatever part of my body he could get his mouth on or pinning me and hissing dirty talk in my ear or grinding his knee into my groin&mdash;it&hellip; makes focusing on the fight far more difficult. Pain I can ignore, but it&rsquo;s not like I can just shut out all physical sensations. </p>
<p  >It had surprised me at first, but it made sense when I thought about it&mdash;it&rsquo;s payback for Petey. I don&rsquo;t deserve to have my feelings considered when it comes to sex anymore, anyway, so it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;d discouraged him from doing it. But now I thought back to some of the things he&rsquo;d been doing. A few weeks ago right before the most recent reset he&rsquo;d pinned me to a wall and dragged the flat of his tongue up my neck. </p>
<p  >I narrowed my eyes, drawing my knees in to myself. Had I <em>liked</em> that? At the time I hadn&rsquo;t noticed anything odd, but&hellip; bringing the moment back to the forefront of my mind, I recalled how roughly he&rsquo;d shoved me. I slowed the memory down when I got to the lick. I re-played it, over and over, trying to find the answer&mdash;I even lifted my hand to that spot on my neck. I shivered, thinking about how I&rsquo;d been subtly aware of that patch of skin for the rest of the day. Like I had been branded. I licked my lips, easily recalling how warm and <em>alive</em> Jimmy feels when we&rsquo;re fighting.. a bubble of heat quickly grew in my gut; well, that was proof enough to me. I had, in fact, liked it when Jimmy did this. </p>
<p  >Well then. I stood up, with at least one question answered. Now, had that been his plan all along? To get me to be attracted to him? That made me narrow my eyes in thought as I started to pace. But that didn&rsquo;t make sense&hellip; the whole point was to put me through the same shit I&rsquo;d done to Petey. Why would he want me to like him if it was supposed to be revenge? I shook my head; No, no&hellip; me actually  <em> enjoying </em>  this behavior was almost certainly unintentional. </p>
<p  >Of course, now that I knew I liked it&hellip;   I sighed  &mdash;it made no sense to let it continue. Even if Jimmy still thought it bothered me, <em>I</em> would enjoy it, and.. well, I don&rsquo;t deserve that. Then how to avoid the fights? I obviously couldn&rsquo;t tell Hopkins to cut it out, but they&rsquo;d be easy to avoid&mdash;he&rsquo;s just too easy to read. That just left one thing. </p>
<p  >I groaned, forcing myself to focus on the autumn wind whistled through the rafters of the church. It was better than the memory of pressing my body against him as his tongue lathered the inside of&ndash;I slapped my hand against the side of my head. A lot of people seem to consider sex to be a biological need, but those kinds of people have never spent a significant amount of time starving themselves, or dying of thirst, or avoiding sleep. The desire to have sex is secondary to those basic biological functions, and I usually don&rsquo;t even go out of my way to have sex. But the fact that I&rsquo;m having <em>sexual fantasies</em> about the moron is intolerable. I returned to the brisk fall air, putting my long-term planning on hold for the moment. For now, I needed to purge these fantasies. </p>
<p  >Reaching the path back to town, I moved in the direction of The Vale, trying to recall the day of the week&mdash;time for a quick visit with the local dealer. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 20: Oh Hi Duncan~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >A little blackmail and a little bribery can really go a long way. A short while later found me in a back corner of the Townie hangout, white t-shirt and jeans rather than my usual school uniform. Wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to sneak in if I&rsquo;d just gallivanted around with my Bullworth vest and a &lsquo;please kick the shit out of me&rsquo; sign on my back. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re here then, dipshit?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snapped my eyes over to find the stoner glaring at me, glaring me up and down. Perhaps he was checking for weapons, or the product I was supposed to be trading. Reaching into the back of my pants, I rolled my eyes when he shifted to a defensive stance. I asked, only a little cheekily, &ldquo;What, think I&rsquo;m going to pull a <em>knife</em> on you, dropout?&rdquo; as I tossed the bag of marijuana his way, letting him see that it was not, in fact, a weapon. And I hadn&rsquo;t brought one&mdash;I don&rsquo;t need one for this. </p>
<p  >He glared harder at the &lsquo;dropout&rsquo; jibe, but dropped these theatrics in favor of holding the Easter-egg patterned baggie to the light. What he was checking for, I have no clue. Finally, he said, &ldquo;So, what, you&rsquo;re just <em>giving</em> me this?&rdquo; Skepticism, right on cue&mdash;but his curiousity had been piqued. Now I just had to earn his trust. </p>
<p  >I shrugged, saying, &ldquo;Of course. I said I&rsquo;d give it to you for free,&rdquo; As I talked, I shifted so that my pants slid lower on my hips, letting a little flesh get exposed. I smirked when his eyes flicked down before quickly returning to my face. &ldquo;And I keep my word,&rdquo; Pushing off the boxcar I was leaning against, I advanced toward him slowly. &ldquo;Unless there was something you <em>wanted</em> to do to repay me....&rdquo; His eyebrows shot up at that. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;are you&hellip; coming on to me?&rdquo; He still looked incredulous, but his curiosity was waxing&mdash;and there was a hint of arousal, too. </p>
<p  >I thought about my next line carefully, walking up to him and brushing a hand casually up his arm, as if that was a thing to do. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say to think of this more as&hellip; an opportunity.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I timed it so that when I finished speaking his back hit the wall behind him. &ldquo;Wha&hellip; opportunity for what?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t move in immediately, but I stayed <em>just</em> close enough that he couldn&rsquo;t have moved away without being rude; an automatic social instinct that is surprisingly easy to exploit if you know what you&rsquo;re doing. </p>
<p  >I smirked before rocking forward and whispering softly into his ear, &ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your chance to vent some frustration about those assholes at Bullworth,&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t tried this approach with this one before, but given what I knew about his history with bullies I figured he might be into something like what I was looking for. The thought of Ji&ndash;somebody forcing me to my knees and making me blow them, pinning me to the ground and raking their nails down my back, just <em>taking</em> without asking, had been dancing in my mind&rsquo;s periphery as I&rsquo;d been setting this up. There was something powerful about the idea of being.. punished, I suppose, for what I&rsquo;d done. </p>
<p  >I kissed him right after whispering that line, nibbling on his lower lip. I relaxed a little when I felt him respond eagerly&mdash;good sign. As he opened his mouth to deepen the kiss, I let him take control and he probed my mouth. I had chosen this one mostly for logistical reasons, but my body decided it very much enjoyed the harder muscle and calloused skin. Better than being reminded of Petey, at any rate. He moaned, bringing one hand up to the back of my neck and using the other to grope my torso. I frowned, though&mdash;my dick didn&rsquo;t like the way he sounded; too low pitched. </p>
<p  >So I switched tactics, pressing myself into him harder and planting my hands on either side of the wall instead. The heat in my groin spiked considerably; there, that felt much more natural. Sadly, at that moment he decided to pull away, panting. &ldquo;Heh, you tryin&rsquo; to <em>buy</em> my love, schoolboy?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes at that, muttering, &ldquo;Hardly; I just need your lust,&rdquo; as I dropped my hands to the front of his pants. </p>
<p  >That hadn&rsquo;t seemed like an invitation to speak to <em>me</em>, but he seemed to decide it was because he continued talking as I undid his belt. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s working!&rdquo; I reached my unoccupied hand up to yank his mouth to my neck. </p>
<p  >I whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think there are more <em><u>useful</u></em> things you could be doing with that mouth?&rdquo; as I finally got his belt undone&mdash;the button and zipper of the jeans were much shorter work. He chuckled but refrained from more talking, instead taking it upon himself to coat my throat in saliva. With no pesky underwear to deal with, I finally began stroking him. Now that I could relax a little, I took the time to close my eyes and focus on the sensations&mdash;he seemed reluctant to do anything that might leave a mark, instead content to trace patterns with his tongue. That was good; I didn&rsquo;t want to have to explain any obvious hickeys. The wet and warmth of the licking combined with the hard body I was pressing into were&hellip; nice. But even as I felt the member in my hand become engorged, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to get enough blood circulating to get it up myself. </p>
<p  >That problem suddenly vanished when he grabbed my ass and pulled my lower half closer to his; it was so sudden I was immediately reminded of Jimmy yanking on my belt earlier. My brain was suddenly drowning in chemicals as I began mindlessly rubbing my crotch against his leg. &ldquo;Ahfuckyesss&rdquo; And Jimmy&rsquo;s tongue was lapping and massaging and tasting my throat and I could feel his erection rubbing against my leg and I wanted him so <em>fucking</em> bad&mdash; </p>
<p  >But then he whispered, &ldquo;Ya <em>like</em> that, school boy?&rdquo; And the spell was broken. It wasn&rsquo;t the moron running his hands over my torso so enthusiastically or pulling me toward him so roughly, it was just some mindless loser that I&rsquo;d gotten to do my bidding. The sudden fire that&rsquo;d lit up my crotch died back down, and I sighed. It&rsquo;s Jimmy <em>specifically</em> that I&rsquo;m attracted to, then; figures. My sudden lack of movement seemed to register and the loser pulled back. My lip curled as I saw his face come into my field of vision&mdash;seeing him made it even clearer how <em>not</em> Jimmy he was. He started to say &ldquo;Hey, you okay, br-&rdquo; but I started reaching for the hem of his shirt to disguise the hesitation. </p>
<p  >Well, if I was going to get this attraction out of my system, I was going to have to pretend like this was Jimmy&mdash;luckily, I&rsquo;ve had plenty of time to practice proxy-fucking. As I pulled his shirt up, I said huskily, &ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t worry &lsquo;bout me&mdash;just give me what I <em>deserve</em>,&rdquo; I forced myself to look in his face as the shirt came up over his head; I needed to see his reaction to that statement to know if it had the desired effect. </p>
<p  >Luckily, it seemed so as he grinned lustily. &ldquo;Oh, you like it rough, schoolboy?&rdquo; I tossed his shirt to the side as the hand that had been gripping the back of my head migrated downward to fully grasp my butt. As I leaned my face to press into his neck and thus spare myself the need to look at him, he growled, &ldquo;Wanna see how we do it on the wrong side &lsquo;a the tracks?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Rather than respond, I opted to lick his neck as I thought of how I wanted this to go. I closed my eyes, letting the memories of fighting with Jimmy rush back in and fuel a new fire in my gut. Forcing myself to keep an even tone, I hissed, &ldquo;<em>Yeah</em>; make me <em>suffer</em> for what I&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; before grabbing his ear with my teeth, squeezing enough to hear him cry out in pain. I immediately brought my hands down from the wall and started stroking him as I licked his ear apologetically; hopefully that wasn&rsquo;t too much&mdash;I was hardly interested in inflicting pain on him, after all. </p>
<p  >His breathing evened out for a couple seconds after my bite as I patiently nosed his ear and slowly stroked his member. The slowly-returning hardness indicated that pain was not something this loser wanted. Hardly surprising. &ldquo;Y-you want me ta <em>hurt</em> &lsquo;chya? Um&hellip;&rdquo; I brought my hand away from him while he talked, deciding to put all the excess saliva I&rsquo;d been producing to good use. I forced myself to gauge his reactions as I thoroughly covered the palm of my hand before resuming my task. He looked pleasantly surprised, but still a bit shaken at the seemingly dark turn a normal handjob had taken. I&rsquo;d have to better than that to get what I needed. </p>
<p  >I adopted my best impression of Femme Boy&rsquo;s puppy dog eyes and said, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, <em>please</em>?&rdquo; My increased grip and faster motions probably did more to support my point than my expression, but either way he looked a bit less freaked out. I continued, &ldquo;I promise you&rsquo;ll like it.&rdquo; Now that was a flat-out lie. I had no idea what he&rsquo;d think, but I didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;if it got him to do it, I was willing to say anything. </p>
<p  >He moaned, and began rhythmically tightening his grip on my butt. Even so, he opened his eyes and panted out, &ldquo;I, uh, I dunno, can&rsquo;t we just do&rdquo; Here he shifted his hips forward a bit into my hand. &ldquo;<em>this</em> kina stuff?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I sighed, and replied, &ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s how you feel.&rdquo; before abruptly pulling my hand away, using it to remove his hand from my ass and step back as I casually wiped my hands off on my pants. </p>
<p  >He gaped for a bit before shifting to anger. &ldquo;Hey! What the fuck, man!?&rdquo; I gave him a disappointed shrug as I backed up. He advanced after me a step, adding, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just fucking <em>leave</em> me like this!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I raised an eyebrow questioningly as I crossed my arms. &ldquo;Oh? And why not?&rdquo; I interrupted him before he had the chance to go off on me. &ldquo;I held up my end of the bargain, at pretty considerable expense to myself I might add.&rdquo; I gestured to the bag of drugs that had been tossed to the side and forgotten in the thick of things. Then I held up my hands in a &lsquo;surrender&rsquo; gesture as I turned around and began meandering down the hall. &ldquo;But, if you don&rsquo;t want to continue, I&rsquo;m <em>sure</em> jerking yourself will feel just as good as my hand would&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I smirked privately to myself when I felt a hand wrap around my arm. &ldquo;<em>Jesus</em> fine, whatever, just get back here!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I turned my head, looking at him evenly but keeping my body angled away from him. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll do what I want?&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t care less about his pleasure&mdash;I had jumped through a ton of hoops to get here, and I intended to get what I had come for. </p>
<p  >He groaned exasperatedly, moving closer to my arm and bringing my hand to his still-turgid member. &ldquo;Yeah, whatever bro. You want it, you got it.&rdquo; I smirked&mdash;perfect. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;All right, then.&rdquo; And I brought my left hand down to stroke him, re-applying saliva to my right before bringing that down as well. I rolled my eyes as he started moaning. Now that I had a goal, though, I could focus more&mdash;time to get this over with as quick as possible. He was getting close, but my hand was tired of pumping so furiously. So, I knelt and, after making sure he had noticed my change in position, leaned forward and slathered my tongue over the head before sucking it into my mouth. </p>
<p  >Judging by the way he yelled, &ldquo;Holy FUCK!&rdquo; and grabbed the back of my head, he enjoyed it. I began humming, and the vibrations combined with the pressure provided by my throat led to a few seconds of frankly <em>hilarious</em> unintelligible babbling before the warm saltiness of semen hit my taste buds. I pulled out pretty fast, moving my face out of the way as my hand helped him finish up. </p>
<p  >I scraped the spunk coating the inside of my mouth off with my other hand, flicking it away as I got back to my feet. I was proud of myself for managing to keep the disgust to a minimum. Heavy breathing was the only sound for the next few seconds as he leaned against the nearby wall. I gave it another few moments before saying, &ldquo;Well, then. Looks like it&rsquo;s my turn.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He looked up at me, panting having slowed to a couple deep breaths as his face broke into a grin and he shook his head. &ldquo;Whoo, yeah! You fuckin&rsquo; earned that, Jesus dude&hellip;&rdquo; Then he moved off the wall, before looking uncertain. &ldquo;So. Uh. What do you want me to do, exactly?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I tapped my chin as I shifted through my memories of the moron, picking out the one I had been considering a few hours ago; him pinning me and licking my neck. I looked the Townie in the eye and began explaining. &ldquo;I want you to treat me like we&rsquo;re in a fight&mdash;pin me to the wall,&rdquo; here I pointed to the one across from us just for an example, &ldquo;as hard as you can, and&hellip;&rdquo; I swallowed before continuing, &ldquo;bite and scratch my back and neck while you jerk me off,&rdquo; He considered this and opened his mouth to speak before I remembered to add, &ldquo;Oh, and don&rsquo;t talk. I&rsquo;ll let you know what feels good, just&hellip; stay quiet.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He looked rather disturbed by all this. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk? Wha&hellip; but&hellip; how hard d&rsquo;jya want me to bite? I mean, I can bite pretty hard.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I grinned as I turned away. &ldquo;Trust me, you&rsquo;re going to have to try <em>pretty</em> hard to get to a point where it&rsquo;s <em>too</em> painful.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not like it was going to kill me, after all. I grabbed his hands and began guiding him over to the wall&mdash;I faced the wall with him to my back. I could feel my heart-rate picking up, doing my best to ignore the fact that I <em>knew</em> it wasn&rsquo;t Jimmy standing behind me. Licking my lips, I turned my head so it seemed as if I was looking over my shoulder, but I kept my gaze averted from him. &ldquo;So when you shove me, just pretend, oh I don&rsquo;t know, that I&rsquo;m a Bullworth Academy student.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I heard him laugh a little and reply, &ldquo;Okay then, schoolboy; you got it,&rdquo; I closed my eyes and took a deep breath as I pulled my shirt off and braced myself against the wall. I just hoped he wouldn&rsquo;t pussy ou&mdash;my thought was interrupted by my whole body being slammed, <em>hard</em>, into the metal wall. </p>
<p  >I groaned as I felt a solid body flatten me and oh wow it felt <em>so good</em>. &ldquo;Ummmyeah; just like thatooohh&hellip;&rdquo; My fast-stiffening dick was now being compressed between the weight of the body behind me and the wall, and I started humping it as best I could. After a moment, though, the pressure began to let up. Fuck, what the hell? &ldquo;<em>NO</em>, stupid, <em>harder</em>!&rdquo; I could almost hear the moron laughing at how desperate I sounded but fuck I <em>was</em> desperate at this point. The pressure returned, but there weren&rsquo;t any of the usual freshly-administered bruises or small scratches from rolling around during our confrontations&mdash;weird, I hadn&rsquo;t even noticed how good they felt before&mdash;without those elements much was lost. I squeezed my eyes shut and gritted my teeth muttering &ldquo;Come <em>on</em> moron&rdquo; to myself; &ldquo;give people <em>some</em> indication of how fucked up I am!&rdquo; Finally, he started scratching in small, short bursts down my back. I growled; fucking hell, talk about unsatisfying! I hissed, &ldquo;Aw, you can do better than <em>that</em>!&rdquo; I grinned to myself and added, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see some <em>blood</em>, moron.&rdquo; A pause. Then, I felt nails dig deeper into my flesh and begin scouring my back. I moaned unintelligibly and shuddered again&mdash;oh <em>God</em> slow, deliberate pain lit my neurons so the heat already pooled in my groin felt like it was being siphoned off to run in liquid form down my back. I dropped my hands from the wall and jammed them down my pants, blindly rubbing whatever I could. All I could feel was heat&mdash;I was being burned alive. &ldquo;aaaaah <em>more</em>, hhmm&hellip;&rdquo; It was horrible, but at the same time it felt so <em>right</em>. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right, psycho. You fuckin&rsquo; <em>deserve</em> this.&rsquo; The messy complexities of the world, the analyses and predictions, all fell away at that simple fact; I deserved this. I felt teeth sink into my shoulder as the scratching deepened further and it was like I was being ripped open so the fire could slip into my bloodstream, my <em>bones</em> and the world shrunk to my pain and Jimmy&rsquo;s body. For some reason, my lust-clouded mind became seized with the desire to apologize; if I died now he wouldn&rsquo;t know I hadn&rsquo;t wanted to hurt them! I started whispering &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m so sorry&hellip;&rdquo; into my arm as my insides melted from the blazing heat. &lsquo;If you were sorry you wouldn&rsquo;t fucking <em>be</em> here, psycho,&rsquo; and the acidic guilt that dissolved my throat as I swallowed caused me to start shaking even with Jimmy holding me down and keeping me together and alive through sheer force of will or something because how else could I still be here? &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m sorryi&rsquo;msorryi&mdash;&rdquo; but then something tugged my boxers down and cool air suddenly hit the source of it all, which was now positively thrumming with blood. My entire body seized up when I felt the hands that I had thought were busy ripping me open run comparatively gently across the overheated flesh of my back and I felt one reach down and begin stroking me with the same deliberateness as they&rsquo;d burned a trail down my back. The heady, white-hot lust began to drain away; I felt his tongue lapping at the bite mark he&rsquo;d embedded in my shoulder earlier. Now those warm hands were wiping away all the pain and the guilt and the rage and the jealousy to just leave the pleasure. I drew several ragged breaths so I could keep apologizing though for what, I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure anymore. All I knew was that he was saying it was alright, and if Jimmy thought things were okay that meant they were, right? And even though <em>nothing</em> was fine it would never <em>be</em> fine the confidence of his stroking at least let me believe that maybe things would be fine one day. My entire body shuddered as I came, and for a few glorious moments of quiet the unwavering forgiveness Jimmy&rsquo;s hands had offered felt <em>real</em>. </p>
<p  >But of course, reality had to come back in and ruin my fucking day. &ldquo;So. Uh&hellip; that was&hellip; good?&hellip;&rdquo; Not Jimmy. Never Jimmy. I nodded as I panted anyway, and the loser replied &ldquo;Right&hellip; cool,&rdquo; before stepping away. Continuing to catch my breath as I bent down to pick up the shirt I&rsquo;d discarded, I checked my watch. Eight twenty. I missed dinner long ago; I&rsquo;d have to catch them at the dorm or something. &ldquo;That was, uh. Pretty intense, dude&mdash;you sure you&rsquo;re okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snorted as I hastily pulled my shirt on. &ldquo;Like <em>you</em> could help if I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I assessed the damage as the fabric brushed against me&mdash;the scratches and bites were in areas normally covered up by my uniform, so no problems there. Couldn&rsquo;t have Femme Boy and the moron thinking anything untoward happened. Tucking myself back in and making my way down the corridor, I added, &ldquo;Enjoy your product, friend.&rdquo; I rubbed a hand against my eye as I picked up the bike I&rsquo;d arrived on and zipped up my pants; well, at least that was over with. Now to change before heading back to school. As I pedaled past warehouses on my way to the comic shop, I began assessing possible contingency plans in case Jimmy&rsquo;s idiotic sex-addled mind decided to pull another stunt like he had this afternoon. </p>
<p > ~~~ </p>
<p  >Twenty or so minutes later I was pulling up to school, uniform on but <em>still no plan</em>. I swear, Jimmy kissing me had somehow passed on his testicle-brain disease to me; it was like I didn&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to think of a way out of such a situation again. I scowled as I pulled one of the garage doors open, wheeling my bike in. That deal with the Townie was supposed to <em>stop</em> shit like this from poisoning my mind! </p>
<p  >I could figure this all out later. First things first; find Jimmy and Petey. If I didn&rsquo;t show up for an entire night, Petey would no doubt start to wonder what happened, and I could <em>not</em> handle him finding out. As I headed in the direction of the dorm though, the tell-tale sound of a skateboard came up behind me and bashed into my right shoulder. &ldquo;Shit, sorry!&rdquo; I glared at him as he skidded to a halt, making eye contact with me. &ldquo;Oh, hey psycho! We were wondering where you&rsquo;d fucked off to,&rdquo; He hopped off, kicking the board up casually as he made his way over to where I&rsquo;d stumbled. Jabbing his thumb behind him, he added, &ldquo;Pete &lsquo;n me were just gonna go get some dinner. You wanna come?&rdquo; Throughout this small exchange I&rsquo;d automatically scanned him up and down; I nearly slapped myself in the face. </p>
<p  >For <em>fuck&rsquo;s sake</em> it hadn&rsquo;t worked at <em>all</em>! I could suddenly feel my clothes moving over the scratches on my back, which I forced myself to ignore. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t get dinner when it was, I don&rsquo;t know, <em>dinnertime</em>?&rdquo; Jimmy turned in the direction of the dorm, meaning my eyes were drawn magnetically to his butt. I squeezed my eyes shut and began quietly beating my palm against my head. Fuck, fuck, <em>fuck, FUCK!</em> </p>
<p  >In the meantime, the moron snorted. &ldquo;What, and eat fuckin&rsquo; <em>Edna&rsquo;s</em> food?&rdquo; I forced my eyes back open and followed him. When I reached his side, he was sticking his tongue out in disgust. &ldquo;<strong>Fuck</strong> no, I&rsquo;d rather eat her <em>pussy</em>&mdash;at least then I&rsquo;d know what I was getting.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; I kept my gaze trained in front of me, pointedly not looking at his tongue; I swear, it was like realizing I liked Petey all over again. It took <em>years</em> to be able to act normally around him&mdash;and that was with his memory being wiped clean every eight months! If this didn&rsquo;t stop soon Jimmy was bound to notice, moron or not.... </p>
<p  >In my peripheral hearing I heard Jimmy laugh. &ldquo;Haha, seriously man? Not gonna make fun of me for that?&rdquo; Then he swatted my shoulder, making me flinch&mdash;that was where the he had bit me. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Fuck off!&rdquo; I grabbed my head; that hadn&rsquo;t been <em>him</em> it was that loser Townie! My brain refused to believe me, though. </p>
<p  >My arms were blocking my line of sight, so I couldn&rsquo;t see his expression when he responded testily, &ldquo;Whoa, you havin&rsquo; an <em>episode</em> or some shit, schizo?&rdquo; I removed my hands to re-focus on him, and the hostile stance he was sporting was now incredibly appealing&mdash;I was about five seconds away from just taunting him and <em>letting</em> him beat the shit out of me and then going to jerk off somewhere, but by then I could see Petey walking over to us from over his shoulder. </p>
<p  >He waved cheerily when he saw me, something that <em>still</em> blows my mind. &ldquo;Hey, guys! What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy snorted, replying, &ldquo;I think the psycho&rsquo;s PSMing or some shit.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey rolled his eyes, replying &ldquo;Riiiight.&rdquo; Then he looked over at me and began furrowing his brows in his Femme Boy way. &ldquo;You okay, Gary? Uh, we were going to go get something to eat&hellip; you wanna come?&rdquo; Fuck, he could tell <em>he knew</em>. </p>
<p  >I crossed my arms across my chest as I replied in the coolest tone I could muster. &ldquo;You know, I think I&rsquo;ll pass,&rdquo; Smirking as I turned around, I added, &ldquo;Besides, Jimmy-boy here already ate,&rdquo; What did that even mean? It didn&rsquo;t really matter&mdash;it was confrontational and it sounded vaguely insulting. &ldquo;Be seeing you!&rdquo; I made my way briskly to the gates of school. </p>
<p  >Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t fast enough to avoid hearing Jimmy call after me, &ldquo;Aw come on psycho, I think I could go for another bite!&rdquo; It took every ounce of self-control I had to not stop because <em>holy fuck</em> I would&rsquo;ve given <em>anything</em> for that, but good Lord I could not be around him with Petey <em>two feet away</em>; this was getting fucked up, fast. I just <u>barely</u> kept myself from sprinting back to the comic shop I&rsquo;d been staying at. Slamming the door open, the idiot behind the counter looked like he was going to try and say something to me, but I interrupted him. &ldquo;Listen to me, dipshit. You let anybody but me down there, and I will go to your house and <em>stab</em> you to death while you <em>sleep</em>. Got it?&rdquo; He hung his mouth gormlessly open for a moment before I rolled my eyes, moving to go head downstairs. &ldquo;1011 Bleaker street, right?&rdquo; I flashed him a nasty smile before closing the door. Leaning against it, I breathed a sigh of relief. The Nerds wouldn&rsquo;t have their little meeting tonight, what with preparations for the &lsquo;election&rsquo; still happening. Thank God; they had been the worst part about this whole thing. </p>
<p  >As I made my way down the stairs, Jimmy saying &lsquo;Aw come on psycho, I think I could go for another bite!&rsquo; rang though my head again. I shuddered. &lsquo;&hellip;I could go for another bite!&rsquo; I shut the second door to the bedroom portion of the basement, licking my lips as I did so. &lsquo;<em>&hellip;another bite!</em>&rsquo; I leaned my forehead against the closed door, staring blindly at the floor. &lsquo;&hellip;<strong>bite</strong>!&rsquo; Against my better judgement, my hand moved to undo the zipper on my slacks. </p>
<p  >Seemed I wouldn&rsquo;t be interacting with Jimmy until this was sorted out. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 21: Time Dilation~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I could hear him as he panted, every grunt accompanied by a wet slap of skin against skin and the glorious feeling of his cock inside me. &ldquo;Yeah you like that don&rsquo;t you, psycho?&rdquo; I wanted to say yes, that it was fucking awesome, but his hand was clamped over my mouth. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get to speak, <strong>freak</strong>. Just <em>take</em> it.&rdquo; And he sped up, digging his nails into my ass as he trusted and it felt <em>amazing</em> and suddenly my head exploded in pain unrelated to sex. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;FUCK!&rdquo; What the&mdash;I opened my eyes to try and get my bearings, but I couldn&rsquo;t make sense of what I was seeing for a moment. &ldquo;Ow&hellip;&rdquo; I reached up to rub my hand against my head, before realizing I was upside-down, I had fallen out of bed, I had been dreaming, and that I was fucking pathetic. Closing my eyes for a moment I allowed myself a spot of self-pity. &ldquo;Goddamn it&hellip;&rdquo; Sure enough, I could feel the raging-hard on I had in my boxers. I sighed; even my dreams had turned against me. I began pulling up thoughts to turn me off&mdash;Petey describing his grandfather&rsquo;s blood clot is always a good one. I grimaced as I rolled out of the tangle of sheets and blankets; ew. </p>
<p  >I scowled as I got to my feet; I&rsquo;d been here for two days trying to detox this attraction to Jimmy, but to my horror not only had it failed to stop, it had <em>intensified</em>. At first it&rsquo;d just been random thoughts, and I&rsquo;d started masturbating to them, hoping that would stop it. But <em>clearly</em> that hadn&rsquo;t worked. Time for plan B. I checked my watch, which read 10:00 AM&mdash;that was perfect! I threw on the first articles of clothing I could reach and headed out the door; Petey wouldn&rsquo;t be in the dorms now, I could easily run over there and grab a handful of my old ADD meds. I&rsquo;ve long since stopped needing them to act passably normal, but there&rsquo;s nothing better for staying up for a long time without a break. And I clearly needed to nip this in the bud. </p>
<p  >What&rsquo;s so horrifying about all this is that Jimmy loves to mess with me by acting like he&rsquo;s attracted to me, even though that&rsquo;s clearly impossible. It was as if I&rsquo;d been caught in one of those riddles with no right answer&mdash;I wanted to have sex with Jimmy, but if I acted on that desire, he would realize I wanted him, meaning he would drop the fa&ccedil;ade and get rid of me to prevent me from doing the same thing to him as I did to Petey. Which, if I was honest, was the <em>other</em> reason I couldn&rsquo;t act upon it&mdash;I want Jimmy, and I&rsquo;m still jealous of him&hellip; but I already made that mistake a multitude of times with Petey. I wouldn&rsquo;t force him into anything; doing so would only fuck me over in the end. And of course, I can&rsquo;t kill myself. So that left me with only one option: ignore this until it stopped being a problem. </p>
<p  >I sighed nostalgically as I downed a couple long-acting pills; talk about a blast from the past! While on-campus I took a quick detour to pick up some books and my knife. I <em>had</em> promised Petey that I wouldn&rsquo;t kill myself, but I had a feeling it might come in handy anyway. Even so, I just went back to the comic shop. I read a few books from the library for the entire night, and it passed without incident. I pulled the same thing off the next night, but by hour fifty I was drumming my knife against various surfaces in the basement, trying to figure out if I could make it sound like the tune to &ldquo;Banana Phone&rdquo;. Eventually I did, but it only took a minute to realize how stupid the entire endeavor was; I shook my head, stomping over to sit on the mattress and pull out another book. But even as I read the words I could feel their meaning slide away from my brain, as if it couldn&rsquo;t hold on to it. Well, at least I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about hands grabbing my hair and dragging me down to shove his dick down my thr&mdash;I whacked myself on the head with the book. After a few moments silent consideration, I decided I was getting cabin fever; time to get some fresh air. I changed into some clean clothes, grabbed my meds, slotted my knife into the side of my jeans, and headed out. It was the middle of the afternoon as I nursed a cup of coffee and double-shot of meds. Hm. Where to go? What to do? I still needed to avoid Jimmy, which meant also avoiding Petey. Unfortunately, by now I was so loopy my memory was becoming hazy&mdash;I honestly wasn&rsquo;t sure where they would be. I semi-arbitrarily decided to head over to the carnival. Maybe the light and noise could help me stay awake. </p>
<p  >Around hour three of playing that stupid &lsquo;hit the pitcher game&rsquo;, the poor shlub attending the game decided I&rsquo;d had enough, accusing me of holding up the line of ten people behind me. I wandered around in a daze for a while&mdash;sixty hours was rather pushing it, even for me. Next thing I knew somebody was pressing me against a wall in a dark corner somewhere, vamping out on my neck. I blinked, automatically muttering &ldquo;Shit&hellip;&rdquo; to myself. How had I gotten here? </p>
<p  >My small utterance caused whoever it was to stop, nudge their face against mine, and whisper &ldquo;You okay, babe?&rdquo; I grunted&mdash;ah, the Jock&mdash;figured. He&rsquo;d been my go-to Petey surrogate for a long time. Instead of answering, I started licking his lips, navigating his hand toward my pants. &ldquo;Heh, you that eager f&ndash;  &rdquo;   I nearly groaned in frustration; good <em>Lord</em>, I did not want to hear any shit about his cologne or &lsquo;poundcake&rsquo;. Instead, I shoved more of my tongue into his mouth. At least it kept him quiet. </p>
<p  >When I next opened my eyes, the blonde Bully was shouting and the Jock was saying something, having apparently teleported two feet away from me. I blinked again. Crap&hellip; how long was that? I looked down at my wrist, but my vision blurred suddenly and I couldn&rsquo;t make out the time. Instead, I asked &ldquo;Hey, how long ago did we start making out?&rdquo; I looked up at him, but he wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to me. I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;You know friend, the reason everybody on the team hates you so much is because you&rsquo;re so hostile toward them&mdash;not because you&rsquo;re into guys.&rdquo; &lt;&gt; I smiled when the two stopped shouting and just looked at me. I pounced on the momentary quiet. &ldquo;Right, so now that that&rsquo;s out of the way, how long ago did you and I start kissing?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He responded with a very articulate &ldquo;&hellip;  huh?  &rdquo; Luckily, his idiot &lsquo;boyfriend&rsquo; was more responsive. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Hey, you wanna fight me, dill  &mdash;&rdquo;   For God&rsquo;s I don&rsquo;t have fucking time for this! </p>
<p  >I made my hand snap close in a &lsquo;shut up&rsquo; motion as I interrupted him. &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s fucking great, listen; I am currently having periodic blackouts, and&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure neither of you have read <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em>, but it&rsquo;s a very similar situation to being unstuck in time except it&rsquo;s all in order and&hellip;&rdquo; I shook my head. There were some weird spots in my vision, now. &ldquo;You know what, it doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter. Long story short; knowing what time I was last cognizant would be <em>super-duper helpful!</em>&rdquo; I gave him a friendly smile that I didn&rsquo;t put any effort into not making manic. I then turned toward the one I had been making out with, saying &ldquo;That felt like a couple of minutes to me, is that about right?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >His eyes flicked from me to the blonde as he talked. &ldquo;Uh&hellip; &lt;we started making out a couple hours ago if that&rsquo;s what you mean&gt;no, that was&hellip; like, a couple hours ago, man&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;Oh, boy.&rdquo; That didn&rsquo;t sound good. I started rooting around in my pockets for my meds, walking away as I quickly checked the time again, and my vision luckily held out&mdash;<em>eight-thirty!?</em> Jesus, no wonder it was so dark. I&rsquo;d better be careful I didn&rsquo;t get caught by any cops on my way back.&nbsp; &lt;&gt; </p>
<p  >I blinked, and suddenly someone was dragging me by my arm. I flinched, darted my eyes around&mdash;I was in a clothing shop, and the guy dragging me was muttering, &ldquo;&hellip;how far the Smiths have fallen, <em>shoplifting</em>, honestly!&rdquo; Then he turned to look back at me, adding in a disappointed voice, &ldquo;I would call the <em>police</em> if I didn&rsquo;t know your parents, young man!&rdquo; He yanked the door to the shop open and shoved me through, making me stumble as he shouted, &ldquo;And <em>don&rsquo;t</em> come back, thief!&rdquo; before slamming the door. I frowned, wondering what he meant by &lsquo;shoplifting&rsquo; before I noticed my vest felt far more bulky than usual. I shook my head, trying to get my bearings. </p>
<p  >&lt;&gt; Unfortunately that caused me to blink again, and this time somebody had grabbed my head and was pressing my skull into the ground and yelling, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;tchya say that to my <em>face</em>  , rich boy!?  &rdquo; I shoved them off, reaching for my knife automatically. As soon as it was in my hand though, somebody I hadn&rsquo;t noticed tackled me to the ground again, face-first this time, and kicked it out of my hand. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Holy cannoli, was that a <em>knife</em>  !?  &rdquo; Somebody kicked me in the side, I didn&rsquo;t see who. &ldquo;You gonna <em>cut us up</em>  , trust-fund baby!?  &rdquo; I felt weirdly cold&mdash;as I curled in on myself to shield my stomach, I realized I wasn&rsquo;t wearing my usual vest. I squeezed my eyes shut; at least I knew what I&rsquo;d shoplifted earlier. </p>
<p  >I blinked, and suddenly I was on a rooftop, the sky lightening in what was clearly morning. I checked my watch. Seven-thirty. Ohhh shit&hellip; this was getting <em>bad</em>.   I heard a derisive snort from behind me. &ldquo;Yeah, <em>I&rsquo;ll</em> say!&rdquo; I closed my eyes, feeling the ache of lack of sleep pressing on the back of my eyeballs. Of <em>course</em> the one person I wanted to avoid at all costs had found me. I heard Hopkins lean against the wall of the building we were on top of as he added, &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m complainin&rsquo;&mdash;view&rsquo;s pretty great from where I&rsquo;m standing.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I didn&rsquo;t turn around. My memory flooded with images and sensations from the dreams and fantasies I had been having for the past week&mdash;I ignored them, simply replying, &ldquo;What do you want, moron?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He chuckled darkly at that. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be smart or something?&rdquo; I clutched at my head&mdash;I felt woozy; there was a buzzing noise that <em>just</em> brushed into my range of audible hearing. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it obvious?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I hissed &ldquo;NO. It&rsquo;s NOT.&rdquo; Even through the buzzing I heard Jimmy walk up behind me&mdash;I could feel his body heat on my back. I fought the temptation to lean into it. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;I want <em>you</em>, genius.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t respond, but Jimmy must have sensed something because he kept talking. &ldquo;I wanna fuckin&rsquo; cover you in saliva. I wanna shove you to the ground until you beg me to fuck you. I wanna make you <em>scream</em> for me.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I gritted my teeth at the heat that pooled in my groin at those words. They were clenched so tight I had to force my next sentence out. &ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo; I buried my head in my arms, turning away from the lightening sky and leaning against the building. God, I was so tired. </p>
<p  >He chuckled again. &ldquo;&lsquo;Snot how it works, Gary.&rdquo; He leaned closer to my ear and I flashed on one of the dreams; hot breath blowing on my neck as he ground against me from behind. He whispered now. &ldquo;&mdash;you gotta want it, too.&rdquo; I groaned, pressing myself into the wall to try and get away. It didn&rsquo;t work. </p>
<p  >I half-mumbled, &ldquo;What, I have to <em>say</em> it?&rdquo; into my arm. The buzzing was getting louder. He didn&rsquo;t say anything, but the heat at my back began receding. &ldquo;&hellip;wait.&rdquo; He stopped, but didn&rsquo;t move closer. &ldquo;&hellip;I&hellip;I  &mdash;&rdquo;   what <em>do</em> I want? &ldquo;I want  &mdash;&rdquo;   I heard the desperation in my voice as I unwrapped my arms, bracing my hands on the wall. &ldquo;Just.. <em>please</em>&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I felt his breath ghost over my neck as he laughed again before pulling away. He spoke casually as he backed up, ignoring my whine at the increased distance. &ldquo;Want <em>what</em>  ?   C&rsquo;mon, psycho, be specific.&rdquo; In my fog of lack of sleep a crystal-clear memory of how he&rsquo;d yanked on my belt to pull me closer a few days ago, moaning at the friction lodged itself firmly at the forefront of my mind. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> what I want. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;you&rdquo; I was surprised I actually responded. And&hellip; now that I&rsquo;d said it, it was true. </p>
<p  >He hm&rsquo;d thoughtfully, like he was considering my answer. &ldquo;I dunno, that&rsquo;s pretty vague. What <em>about</em> me do you want?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I balled my right hand into a fist, but now that I&rsquo;d admitted it, the words came a little easier. &ldquo;I want <strong>you</strong>, Jimmy.&rdquo; A shiver wracked my body when I said his name&mdash;or maybe it was because I was so tired. Sensations were blending together at this point. </p>
<p  >The heat at my back had returned&mdash;I heard him slam his hands to cage me in, like I had to him a week ago. He growled, &ldquo;Yeah? What else?&rdquo; I mentally cycled through the dreams. </p>
<p  >I picked one that made me shudder. &ldquo;I want you to bite me.&rdquo; He growled encouragingly at that, so I continued. &ldquo;Suck my neck &lsquo;till I can&rsquo;t even <em>feel</em> your mouth anymore.&rdquo; I felt hot all over now, not just where he was touching my back. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;You want me to <em>mark</em> you?&rdquo; I nodded, keeping my eyes closed. It felt good to finally admit it. &ldquo;You wanna be <em>mine</em>, psycho?&rdquo; I shivered as I let out an unintelligible affirmative noise. <em>YES</em>. I wanted it so<em> <strong>bad</strong></em>&mdash;somebody that actually  <em> matters </em>  genuinely wanting to have sex with me? That was exactly what I&rsquo;d always wanted. I moved off the wall trying to press against him, but he moved away. &ldquo;Ah ah ah, not so fast  &mdash;&rdquo;   I growled; I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore, whirling around to grab him and to <em>hell</em> with it I just wanted to do <em>something</em> to him, make him stop sounding like he was fucking  <em> above </em>  this somehow&mdash;but I stumbled forward, through the space that I could&rsquo;ve sworn Jimmy had just occupied. I whipped my head back and forth, trying to find him somewhere on the rooftop&hellip; but I was alone. </p>
<p  >The screaming started before my knees even hit the ground. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~ Chapter 22: Between You and Gary, That&rsquo;s Not Saying a Lot~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >&lt;Chapter in need of heavy edits&gt; &lt;no seriously&gt; &lt;a lot of edits&gt; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Aw come on psycho, I think I could go for another bite!&rdquo; I sighed to myself as Gary practically sprinted away. Something is up with him, no doubt about it. </p>
<p  >Adjusting my backpack strap I gave Jimmy a sidelong look as we made our way toward The Vale. &ldquo;Did you really need to taunt him like that?&rdquo; Jimmy looked <em>way</em> too pleased with himself about that. </p>
<p  >He snorted   and stuffed his hands in his pockets as we walked together, giving me a shit-eating grin. &ldquo;Aw, lighten up, Pete! &lsquo;Sides, &lsquo;snot like he&rsquo;s gonna go <em>cry</em> about it,&rdquo; He shrugged as we passed the bike rack. I spotted one of the Greasers&mdash;I was pretty sure his name started with an R&mdash;and gave him a cheery wave as Jimmy continued. &ldquo;Gary&rsquo;s a big boy, he can handle himself.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I nodded. &ldquo;Fair point,&rdquo; Frowning, I added &ldquo;Still, though&mdash;you said he reacted weirdly to the kiss&hellip; wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to go easy at first?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy snorted, frowning for the first time since he&rsquo;d suddenly run up to me in the middle of the hallway. He had been so excited that he&rsquo;d practically shoved Chad out of the way to tell me the good news about how he got to kiss Gary. Back in the present, he muttered, &ldquo;if he&rsquo;s not ready for somethin like that he&rsquo;s welcome to tell me to buzz off.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I managed to suppress the desire to roll my eyes. &ldquo;Uh, last I checked you&rsquo;re supposed to make sure somebody wants to make out with you <em>before</em> doing it,&rdquo; Jimmy had the grace to look embarrassed, but he didn&rsquo;t say anything, just shrugging wordlessly. Surprise, surprise. Oh well; it&rsquo;s hardly my business who Jimmy or Gary has sex with. &ldquo;Whatever, man; just don&rsquo;t be all surprised when Gary flips out and starts catching squirrels to roast over a fire and avoiding society.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy snickered at that. I smiled, falling into the rhythm of conversation and putting the issue out of my mind. It was probably fine&mdash;and I&rsquo;d spent enough brainpower thinking about Gary for a lifetime. </p>
<p  >~~~ </p>
<p  >I wasn&rsquo;t too surprised when we didn&rsquo;t hear from Gary for the rest of the night. He often went off and did his own thing&mdash;nothing unusual. Not hearing from him the next day was a little worrisome, but I honestly didn&rsquo;t think much of it. It was only when neither Jimmy nor I heard from him all day &lt;thrusday&gt; that had me worried. Luckily, during my afternoon free period, I stumbled on a clue pointing toward what might&rsquo;ve happened while in Blue Skies.   I&rsquo;d been rummaging around in the dump&mdash;which, yeah, dangerous, but I&rsquo;d done the same plenty of times before, and I had a feeling I could find something cool for this sculpture idea I had. As I was inspecting a clearly-broken bike, wondering if I could use it for anything, a shadow had suddenly loomed over me. I dodged just in time&mdash;which earned a grunt from the boy that&rsquo;d attacked me. I did the usual &lsquo;try and apologize&rsquo; thing, but I didn&rsquo;t know him well enough for that to work. Luckily, as he threw attacks and I kept rolling out of the way, I recalled his name; Duncan! The Townies are particularly hard to befriend&mdash;they&rsquo;re generally too hostile to do something as cordial as introduce themselves. I smiled a little, remembering how friendly Duncan had been a couple loops ago when Jimmy and I had helped him throw water balloons at people. &lsquo;Yer alright, pink-shirt kid!&rsquo; had been his exact words, I believe. Unfortunately, he wasn&rsquo;t being at all friendly now. Eventually, while he was panting from exhaustion, I said &ldquo;Duncan, look, I&rsquo;m really sorry that I&ndash;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >But he interrupted me by glaring. &ldquo;Hey, how d&rsquo;ya know my name?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Stupidly, I said &ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; in a super guilty way, so of course his face turned mad. I shook my head, adding &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not weird, I swear! A friend of mine just knows you, sorry,&rdquo; I scratched the back of my neck, trying to look as un-intimidating as possible (not that that was much of a challenge) as I added &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think how weird it&rsquo;d sound that I know your name, ha!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He said &ldquo;Riiight&hellip;&rdquo; rather uncertainly, but straightened up. Now that we&rsquo;d stopped fighting, he gave me a closer inspection and blinked in surprise. &ldquo;Hey, I know you! You&rsquo;re that pink-shirt kid that&rsquo;s always hanging out with Gary!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Now it was my turn to blink in surprise. I looked up from the bicycle I&rsquo;d resumed kneeling by, saying uncertainly &ldquo;Well, yes. You know Gary?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He gave an oddly bitter-sounding snort and looked off in the distance as he adopted more closed-off body language. &ldquo;Psh, hardly.&rdquo; Shrugging, he added flippantly &ldquo;Just fucked the guy a couple days ago, ya know. No biggie,&rdquo; My mouth had dropped open by now, but he resumed eye-contact now, smirking slyly. &ldquo;He yer <em>boyfriend</em> or somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The venemant &lsquo;no&rsquo; and the flinch were both automatic reactions. People had been gossiping about such a thing for a while, mostly between Jimmy and Gary (which, I mean, it&rsquo;s Jimmy, so&hellip; you know) but there&rsquo;d been some questions like the one Duncan had just asked. But what was notable about the question was the <em>venom</em> it&rsquo;d been said with. I straightened up and added less violently &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; I watched him carefully, and he seemed weirdly <u>uncomfortable.</u> </p>
<p  >Despite that, he smirked and said &ldquo;I dunno <em>what</em> his damage is, but looks like you and that red-head kid aren&rsquo;t fulfilling his <em>needs</em>, if you catch my drift.&rdquo; And then he winked. </p>
<p  >I took a moment to process this before my stomach sank to the floor with dread. &ldquo;Oh, fuck me!&rdquo; That was the day he&rsquo;d disappeared! Something must&rsquo;ve caused him to freak out or something. But what? </p>
<p  >I thanked Duncan for the advice, but that I had to go. As I propped up my bike, I suddenly remembered how Jimmy had taunted Gary the other day&mdash;shit, it must&rsquo;ve been about the two of them kissing! I rolled my eyes as I headed off down the road; this was going to be painful. </p>
<p  >~~~ </p>
<p  >Jimmy dumped Gary on the mattress as I knelt down next to it and took out the bandages, ice pack, bacterial swabs, and water bottles I&rsquo;d bought. First things first; I handed Jimmy a bottle of water, asking him to go upstairs and boil it in the coffee maker the shop had. As soon as he&rsquo;d jogged upstairs, I took a deep breath to brace myself before pulling Gary&rsquo;s shirt off to swab over the cuts he had. I frowned at the, frankly, surprising number of wounds; but most didn&rsquo;t look worrisome. The one on his shoulder looked like a bite&mdash;no prizes for who&rsquo;s teeth marks <em>those</em> were. But the scratches on his back&hellip; those looked pretty deep. Christ, what is he <em>thinking</em>?  </p>
<p  >Jimmy finally came back downstairs, a coffee-pot of boiling water in hand. He set it down and sat cross-legged next to me, watching as I dunked a rag into the pot to wash Gary&rsquo;s face a bit. &ldquo;So&hellip; wha&rsquo;dya think happened?&rdquo; He frowned to himself, looking down. &ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never seen him <em>cry</em> like that.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I skootched back when I was done, replying &ldquo;Yeah, me neither&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I started unwrapping a bandage as we sat in silence for a few minutes, listening to the muffled music from the shop. Eventually, Jimmy broke the silence with &ldquo;&hellip;do ya think it&hellip; had something to do with me makin&rsquo; out with him?&rdquo; As I stuck a bandage on a cut on Gary&rsquo;s back, I gave Jimmy my best incredulous look. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Um, <em>yeah</em>? Come on, dude&mdash;You know that Gary&rsquo;s got issues about sex up the  <em> wazzoo </em> ,  &rdquo; Jimmy had the decency to look a little embarrassed&lt;&gt;. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Fuck, I <em>know</em> man, I just.. I didn&rsquo;t think..&rdquo; I nodded in understanding as I dug out another band-aid. &ldquo;..shit,&rdquo; Jimmy brought one knee up so he could support his head with his hand. &ldquo;I dunno, I guess.. it just didn&rsquo;t seem like a big deal?&rdquo; he frowned, adding, &ldquo;I mean, it was just a <em>kiss</em>!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I sighed. Again. &lt;&gt; Guess it was time for some Gary and Sex 101. &ldquo;Jimmy, kissing doesn&rsquo;t mean the same thing to you as it does to him,&rdquo; He just scowled. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, I <em>know</em>. But how different can it be? I didn&rsquo;t even touch him that much&hellip;&rdquo; I quirked an eyebrow, and Jimmy let out a huff, saying, &ldquo;Well okay then Gary Whisperer, what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on in that crazy brain of his, then?&rdquo; I snickered&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t a bad title, if a little misleading about how much I understood Gary. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;When Gary&hellip; does something sexual, it&rsquo;s always for a reason,&rdquo; I was surprised how easily this explanation came to me&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t had all that much contact with Gary after all. Jimmy nodded, to show he was listening, and I continued. &ldquo;For Gary, sex&mdash;at least, when it was with <em>me</em>, was&hellip; more of a way to feel like he belonged, or something,&rdquo; I shook my head, laughing a bit. &ldquo;Wow that sounds dumb when I say it like that; still, though&mdash;he was way more concerned with being able to pretend that I felt the same way about him as he did about me than about the physical sensations,&rdquo; I picked up the rag, the action giving me something to focus on as I talked. &ldquo;Like, remember when I was able to get him to agree to unlock you for a while?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy blew a raspberry. &ldquo;Yeah&mdash;how could I fuckin&rsquo; forget it? Not like I could avoid hearing the resulting handjobs.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I grimaced, continuing. &ldquo;He only let me do it that way because he knew it was more comfortable for me, if that makes sense. Otherwise, he always liked doing stuff <em>to</em> me&mdash;but he knew that if he did that, I wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy it. And that was part of the enjoyment for him, you know?&rdquo; Jimmy nodded, a little uncertainly this time. &ldquo;I think what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that Gary didn&rsquo;t just wanna have sex with me&mdash;he wanted way more than that. I&hellip; I think he wanted me to love him,&rdquo; I sighed, sticking a final band-aid on a scrape on Gary&rsquo;s cheek. It had taken me a long time to really realize and understand that. He even succeeded, kinda; he <em>is</em> one of my best friends. Jimmy was looking confused. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Well first of all I wouldn&rsquo;t call <em>that</em> &lsquo;love&rsquo;, but..&rdquo;   he lowered his leg, leaning back on his hands as he frowned thoughtfully. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that shit got to do with me?&rdquo; I shrugged. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Hell, I dunno. All I know is you two spent, like, four months being painfully civil to each other when I was around before you started, like, hate-flirting with him,&rdquo; I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Last <em>I</em> checked, you hate Gary,&rdquo; Making eye contact with Jimmy as he shifted a little awkwardly, I added a little more gently, &ldquo;Is that not true anymore?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy shrugged, scratching the back of his head. &ldquo;  Well  .. I still think you &lsquo;forgiving&rsquo; him is bullshit, but&hellip; I guess I don&rsquo;t <em>hate</em> him?&rdquo; Jimmy frowned, looking at Gary as he talked. &ldquo;I mean&hellip; I&rsquo;m not in uh, love with him. But he <em>is</em> pretty fun to talk to and mess around with,&rdquo; I unscrewed another bottle of water and listened. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s tried to do anything bad to ya since then&hellip;&rdquo; Jimmy finally looked back up at Pete, looking a tad worried. &ldquo;Right?&rdquo; I considered for a moment. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;You know, actually&hellip; Gary&rsquo;s barely touched me <em>at all</em> since then, you know?&rdquo; I cocked my head to the side as I passed Jimmy the water bottle, leaning back in thought. &ldquo;Even before the loops I vaguely remember Gary being pretty.. touchy-feely. But I can probably count on one hand the times he&rsquo;s touched me since then,&rdquo; I took a sip as Jimmy nodded. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yeah. I remember early on, that&rsquo;d be why I&rsquo;d fight him, ya know? He&rsquo;d tap your shoulder or brush against you when we were sitting down at a table and I&rsquo;d use it as an excuse to try &lsquo;n beat him up, ya know?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I kept my face utterly deadpan as I brought the water bottle down. &ldquo;Oh my God. You and Gary have been fighting each other. I had no idea,&rdquo; Jimmy just laughed. &ldquo;But yeah, I mean&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t like him touching me much for a while after, but now that we&rsquo;re friends, it&rsquo;s not so bad.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy shrugged. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s the same for me&mdash;I was just&hellip; madder at him than you,&rdquo; I chuckled, recalling the hours I would spend imagining beating Gary to death in the Preppie gym and the anger that would flare up at any moment and fill me with rage. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Trust me, Jimmy&mdash;<em>nobody</em> was angrier at him than me,&rdquo; I shrugged, sighing. &ldquo;I just got over it faster.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy hmmd, and we let the beeping of the arcade machine in the corner fill the quiet. &ldquo;So&hellip; should I, like, hook up with Gary or somethin&rsquo;  ?  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >I took a deep breath, reminding himself to be patient&mdash;that Jimmy isn&rsquo;t dumb, he just needs time to understand things. &ldquo;I think&hellip; that if you do decide to act on this, you need to remember that it will be more than just a casual hookup,&rdquo; I held Jimmy&rsquo;s gaze as I continued. &ldquo;Even if you both agree that it&rsquo;s just sex or something, it&rsquo;s going to be a permanent change. And you both gotta, ya know, talk,&rdquo; I was pretty sure that Jimmy knew all this far better than I did&mdash;I&rsquo;d never even really been in a romantic relationship, after all. </p>
<p  >Jimmy nodded slowly. &ldquo;Yeah, guess you&rsquo;re right, Pete,&rdquo;   He sighed.   &ldquo;How is it you&rsquo;re the only one of us that manages to have any common sense?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I laughed at that. &ldquo;Haha, between you and <em>Gary</em>, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s saying too much!&rdquo; Jimmy snickered, pulling out a couple comic books he&rsquo;d stuffed down his shirt when we were upstairs as we settled in to wait for our friend to wake up. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~ Chapter 23: Turning Point~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >My body ached all over, but I could tell whatever I was lying on was soft. I groaned, but stopped quickly; my throat felt sore for some reason. I kept my eyes closed to keep the flood of information from the outside world to a minimum; there was some loud beeping and cheering coming from where my feet were, and I wasn&rsquo;t wearing a shirt or shoes, and my hunger and thirst really weren&rsquo;t helping the soreness. </p>
<p  >Okay. Time for the big stuff. I kept my face impassive as I flipped through my memories of last night. It was patchy at best, which meant I was limited to a few key moments&mdash;except for the part about hallucinating a <em>highly</em> vivid conversation with the moron. <em>That</em> I remembered fine. After that, it got fuzzy again, but not so fuzzy that I couldn&rsquo;t remember screaming for a while before losing myself to a panic attack. Wow&mdash;like during the first loop. I didn&rsquo;t have a &lsquo;plan&rsquo; to fall back on this time, though. I heard a yell of &ldquo;  OH MY FUCKING GOD!  &rdquo; in time with a bunch of button mashing. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Come on Jimmy, it&rsquo;s.. it&rsquo;s really not that hard....&rdquo; Oh&hellip; fuck. I opened my eyes. What the hell were <em>they</em> doing here? With my eyes open, I was finally able to take in my surroundings&mdash;under the comic shop? I pushed myself up just to double-check&mdash;how had I gotten here? &ldquo;Oh, Gary! You&rsquo;re awake!&rdquo; I flinched; crap, I should&rsquo;ve kept playing dead. When I looked up, Femme Boy and the moron were abandoning their game to sit at the foot of the mattress. They both seemed worried, but Petey said very carefully, &ldquo;So how&rsquo;re you feeling?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I backed up a bit, pressing my back against the wall and flitting my eyes between the two of them. &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you two doing here?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >The moron&rsquo;s face turned to whut-wat-duh classic and said, &ldquo;  Uh, we  &rsquo;re makin&rsquo; sure you&rsquo;re not dead?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey&rsquo;s eyes widened a bit. &ldquo;Gary, do you remember us finding you?&rdquo; I closed my eyes, shaking my head. No point lying. &ldquo;Oh.. I&rsquo;m sorry, yeah, we, uh&mdash;found you and brought you down here. You were in pretty bad shape, but I think you&rsquo;ll be fine. Just some, uh, scratches and&hellip; yeah!&rdquo; Petey&rsquo;s eyes flicked toward my chest before quickly darting away. I curled up automatically, feeling shame course through my gut. He must&rsquo;ve seen the leftovers from my encounter the other day; I could even feel bandages covering my back. </p>
<p  >The Game Over sound for the game in the corner played and after a moment Hopkins said, &ldquo;Um&hellip; so what happened, dude? You look like fuckin&rsquo; hell,&rdquo; That made Petey snicker, despite the sound of him punching Jimmy reaching my ears. &ldquo;Ow, what? I&rsquo;m just sayin&rsquo;  !  &rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t respond&mdash;what was I supposed to say? &lsquo;Yeah just realized I want you to fuck me, no biggie&rsquo;  ?   Christ, I felt like throwing up&mdash;not only had I further traumatized Petey, I would have to leave town, stop talking to the two of them altogether. </p>
<p  >There was a pause before I heard somebody clap their hands. &ldquo;  Welp! Um  &hellip; I&rsquo;m gonna, uh&hellip; <em>go</em>..&rdquo; I snapped my head up as Petey was pushing himself to a standing position. He couldn&rsquo;t he serious!? </p>
<p  >Jimmy, meanwhile, snorted. &ldquo;<em>Smooth</em>, Pete. Real smooth.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He laughed a little, and I looked between the two of them in confusion. He wasn&rsquo;t really gonna just leave me <em>alone</em> with him, right? &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not <em>leaving</em> are you!?&rdquo; As Petey stopped, I coughed, adding a hasty &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s fine if you want to, I was just curious,&rdquo; as he turned back toward me. I had only noticed the undisguised panic in my voice at the last moment, and hoped my second addition might hide it. </p>
<p  >It seemed he had noticed, since as he resumed heading out he smiled at me reassuringly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Gary&mdash;I&rsquo;m just going for a bit, I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; At that he seemed to have an idea, and added &ldquo;Actually, do you guys want anything?&rdquo; as he pulled his shoes on. He continued, &ldquo;I can bring some stuff by later, or&hellip;&rdquo; Jimmy grinned, opening his mouth but Petey rolled his eyes and added, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s from a store I&rsquo;m legally allowed to enter, Jimmy,&rdquo; He deflated at that. What the hell did that mean? I just shook my head. Petey nodded, straightening to a stand. &ldquo;Cool, then. See you guys later!&rdquo; And he was gone. </p>
<p  >Jimmy laughed a little, leaning toward me in a friendly manner while staying seated on the mattress. &ldquo;Heh, Pete sure knows how to make an awkward exit, huh?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t reply, since I was too busy trying to keep the panic and lust to a minimum. He was being awfully friendly. As the silence stretched on, the grin slowly faltered, and he leaned back into his earlier stance with an awkward, &ldquo;Oh-<em>kay</em> then&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rearranged my legs so I was sitting cross-legged and straightened up; I had to get it together. Scanning him up and down, I tried to figure out why he was here. He clearly wasn&rsquo;t looking for a fight, since his gaze fell on everything but me. Frowning, I studied his outfit; his typical school uniform&mdash;though it might&rsquo;ve had a bit more street grime than usual. Hm. This was going nowhere fast. &ldquo;So what do you want?&rdquo; He started at my question, looking at me with pure whut-wat-duh&mdash;seemed he hadn&rsquo;t expected me to say anything. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; he frowned, processing what I said. &ldquo;What do I want? Whadya mean?&rdquo; I sighed in mild frustration. Wow, hallucination-Jimmy had been far easier to communicate with. </p>
<p  >I tilted my head, raising one eyebrow questioningly. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; What was his game? Had they figured out what had happened over the last few days? I mean, Petey leaving Jimmy alone to sit with me in awkward silence? What was going on? I felt my face twist into a frustrated grimace at my own ignorance. </p>
<p  >He let out a breath, repositioning himself so he was facing me. &ldquo;I wanna, uh, say sorry for making out with you the other day?&rdquo; I blinked, careful to keep the bafflement out of my expression. He grimaced, but seemed to force himself to look me in the eye. &ldquo;I just mean I shoulda made sure you were cool with it first, ya know?&rdquo; He shook his head, adding, &ldquo;Really sent the wrong message, geez.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I tilted my head, narrowing my eyes. &ldquo;Oh? And what message was that?&rdquo; It really didn&rsquo;t seem like he was going to turn violent.... </p>
<p  >He threw a hand out as he answered. &ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t, like, care how you feel, ya know?&rdquo; Who <em>knew</em> what that meant. He continued, &ldquo;I mean, we do our fighting-slash-flirting thing and it&rsquo;s cool, I just&hellip;&rdquo; He shrugged, crossing his arms as he did so. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna, like, <em>rape</em> you or something&hellip;&rdquo; I frowned, unsure of the logical thread he was following. &ldquo;And look, I can stop doing the flirting and stuff if it makes you uncomfortable. I just didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d have, like a fuckin&rsquo; meltdown about it,&rdquo; Furrowing his brow even more than usual, he added &ldquo;I mean&hellip; I figured if you didn&rsquo;t like it you&rsquo;d tell me to cut it out. You know?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >What the hell? &ldquo;Uh, why would me being uncomfortable be a problem? Is that not that the whole point of the mid-fight molestation?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He blinked. &ldquo;Huh? No, &lsquo;course not&mdash;I was just being a horny asshole..   Look man, I  &rsquo;m down if you wanna have, like, <em>actual</em> sex instead of just &lsquo;lust-n-violence&rsquo;, you know?&rdquo; I blinked as every single assumption I&rsquo;d made was suddenly blown clear out of the water. &lt;&gt; Did I want to say yes? Saying yes had been so easy yesterday; but today I was thinking clearly. It was possible Jimmy liked me, but the probability was rather small&mdash;it was far more likely that he was just happy for the convenient fuck. ...still, that was probably as genuine as I was ever going to get. Jimmy snapped his fingers, bringing me back into the present. &ldquo;Hey, &lsquo;s cool if ya don&rsquo;t wanna, okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I closed my eyes, forcing myself to just speak so I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to choose my words. &ldquo;  Yes.  &rdquo; There. It was out&mdash;I breathed a sigh of relief. </p>
<p  >Jimmy blinked, then asked awkwardly, &ldquo;Wait, &lsquo;yes&rsquo; you get what I&rsquo;m saying, or &lsquo;yes&rsquo; you wanna fuck?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >It was all I could do to not scream in exasperation at the situation I now found myself in. &ldquo;Yes I want to <em>fuck</em>, moron. Specifically, I want to fuck <em>you</em>.&rdquo; That put his whut-wat-duh expression back in place. </p>
<p  >Then he grinned &ldquo;Haha, awesome!&rdquo; and started crawling toward me. &ldquo;In <em>that</em> case I&rsquo;m gonna keep doing the fight-flirting too  &mdash;&rdquo;   he was essentially in my lap now, and dipped his voice low as he continued. &ldquo;That shit&rsquo;s pretty fuckin&rsquo; hot,&rdquo; I shivered despite myself as he nudged my legs apart and straddled my lap whilst wrapping an arm around my neck. He leaned his forehead against mine, running a hand over my chest, which, oh yeah I wasn&rsquo;t wearing a shirt. I&rsquo;d forgotten. He started rubbing one of my nipples, saying in a husky voice, &ldquo;By the way, you should go for the shirtless look more often&mdash;it&rsquo;s damn sexy,&rdquo; I let out a breathless sound; something about the situation hadn&rsquo;t sunk in until then, but blood suddenly rushed straight for my crotch as my body realized that the object of my fantasies is <em>here</em> in my <em>lap</em> telling me I&rsquo;m <em>sexy</em>. </p>
<p  >I grabbed the front of his shirt and yanked him forward so we were kissing&mdash;he let out a surprised sound, so I skipped the &lsquo;asking for entrance&rsquo; part and just started exploring his mouth as desperately as I could. Shit&hellip; this was <em>real</em>. I grabbed the back of his neck to pull him even closer, distantly noting that his mouth had a rather sour tinge to it. Jimmy let out a moan, and started rubbing against my tongue just as enthusiastically as I was. I tightened my grip on his neck and waist; <em>this is <strong>real</strong> and he wants it too</em>. </p>
<p  >The kiss wasn&rsquo;t graceful, but there was saliva and teeth and heat and I absolutely did not care how often his teeth clashed into mine, he still <em>wanted</em> it. Eventually, though, my lungs began screaming for air. Oh, right&mdash;that. I pulled away reluctantly, snapping my eyes open as I fell back, panting. Jimmy was breathless too and he grinned, wiping away some excess saliva with the back of his hand as he commented, &ldquo;Shit man, you kiss like you haven&rsquo;t done it in months or something!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I licked my lips, considering his clothing. &ldquo;Ha; try years,&rdquo; I switched my focus to the hand I had around his waist, moving it to the front and slipping it under the shirt, running my hand over his abdomen and making questioning eye-contact. He moved to take off the vest, leaving me to deal with the button-up. </p>
<p  >As he did so, he added, &ldquo;You fuckin&rsquo; liar, Trent said you were makin&rsquo; out with Kirby just yesterday,&rdquo; He tossed it to the left as I fumbled with the buttons on the under shirt&mdash;why do they make them so damn <em>small</em>  ?   Don&rsquo;t the idiots who make these uniforms <em>know</em> teenagers want to be able to take their clothes off quickly at times? He snorted at my frustration and moved in to help speed up the process. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;People who matter, then,&rdquo; I ran my hands over Jimmy&rsquo;s bare chest, feeling how his muscles shifted as he breathed&mdash;he was strangely warm; is his core body temperature higher than average or something? He lowered himself more, giving me easier access&mdash;I uncrossed my legs so he&rsquo;d be able to sit better. </p>
<p  >He snorted while I did so, adding, &ldquo;So who&rsquo;re the people who &lsquo;  matter  &rsquo;, then?&rdquo; Hahaha, <em>what!?</em> </p>
<p  >I made sure to give him my most patronizing look. &ldquo;Um, you and Petey?&rdquo; I rolled my eyes, adding a &ldquo;<em>Duh?</em>&rdquo; for good measure. To my surprise, his eyes widened and he <em>blushed</em>. Now <em>that</em> was a rare sight. So rare I&rsquo;d only seen it once or twice before. </p>
<p  >He broke eye-contact to consider that for a couple moments before looking back up and asking a little quietly, &ldquo;...what, &lsquo;re we the <em>only</em> people who matter to you?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I laughed. &ldquo;Of course you are; isn&rsquo;t it obvious?&rdquo; He shrugged, the blush (to my mild disappointment) fading. I turned my focus to more important matters&mdash;namely, not being entirely certain what to do now. Jimmy shirtless wasn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;d seen very often, so the novelty coupled with this new lust made it a nice sight to behold, but I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what he wanted to do. </p>
<p  >Luckily, he made the decision for me by reaching down and running his hand over my crotch. I let out an involuntary exhale at the contact even through my slacks, and he chuckled. &ldquo;Heh, yeah, guess it&rsquo;s a little obvious,&rdquo; Oh God the <em>heat</em> was fucking <em>incredible</em>&mdash;I felt my hips twitch as I wanted to buck into his hand despite the fact that I was sitting down. I growled, leaning my head onto his shoulder, hating the friction I was denied by my clothes. Apparently, Jimmy had the same idea because he started undoing my belt. As soon as he was done I lifted my hips and shoved my pants off enough so at least my boxers were exposed. &ldquo;Whoa, ya eager for somethin&rsquo; or what?&rdquo; Haha, he had  <em> no idea </em> . </p>
<p  >I straightened up after pulling my pants down, pulling us closer together so I could move my mouth close to his ear and whisper huskily, &ldquo;  Yes.  <em> Very </em> ,&rdquo; as I pressed my lips against his shoulder, I could feel him swallow&mdash;I smirked. Let him see <em>exactly</em> how eager I am. Licking and nipping at his neck a bit, I added mock-casually, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you almost non-stop these past few days, you know,&rdquo; His breathing hitched, and I began drawing a line of sucking and kissing to his Adam&rsquo;s apple. &ldquo;I obsessed about what you&rsquo;d do to me&hellip;&rdquo; I let my hands roam over his chest, noting what areas caused what reactions as I worked my mouth over his neck and shoulders. &ldquo;&hellip;where and how you&rsquo;d fuck me&hellip;&rdquo; He let out a strangled gasp when I bit his throat a little harder, following it up with a particularly hard suck. Who knows, maybe it&rsquo;d end up being visible. &ldquo;&hellip;what you&rsquo;d <em>make</em>   me do,  &rdquo; Jesus, I was rock-hard now; he was so <em>reactive</em>! </p>
<p  >Suddenly, his throat began bobbing up and down as he swallowed in preparation to speak. &ldquo;Y-yeah?&rdquo; I pressed my grin into his skin in lieu of a response. &ldquo;Wh&mdash;<em>fuck</em>  !  &rdquo; I&rsquo;d bitten his collarbone, and was now tonguing the indent of flesh there. I hummed, encouraging him to continue. I smiled to myself at the feel of his growing erection against my leg. &ldquo;What.. uh, would I make ya do?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I pulled back and examined his body the way a sculptor might view a block of marble. &ldquo;Oh, blow you in the doorway of your room so anybody could see what we were doing..&rdquo; I met his gaze as I slowly dragged the tip of my tongue up the pointer finger of my right hand before sucking the whole thing into my mouth to ensure it was totally covered. &ldquo;..bring me <em>riiight </em>up to the edge but make me finish the job so you could watch....&rdquo; I was a little surprised at the expression of shock he was sporting&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always assumed he has people telling him this kind of thing all the time. I drew a slow circle around one of his nipples with the saliva-coated digit. I shrugged, &ldquo;You know. The usual,&rdquo; At that point I leaned forward to scrape his other nipple with my teeth, which made him press himself closer to me&hellip; rubbing his dick against mine and dear God it was like fucking fireworks. &ldquo; <em> nnneugh! </em> &rdquo; was my highly intelligent verbal summary of the experience. </p>
<p  >Jimmy laughed a little breathlessly as I shuddered and immediately tried to replicate the friction, thrusting my hips kind of sporadically. &ldquo;Whoa, you.. haha, <em>wow</em>&hellip;&rdquo; He leaned back a little and, ignoring my whine at the increased distance, stroked me through my boxers. &ldquo;&hellip;you&rsquo;re really into me, huh?&rdquo; The pleasure that resulted from each stroke of his hand <em>holy shit he&rsquo;s doing this because he <strong>wants</strong> to</em> was very distracting. </p>
<p  >I squeezed my eyes shut, focusing on the friction of his hand. &ldquo;Uhhhh mHMmm, <em>yeees</em>, fuck!&rdquo; A small part of me wondered when he&rsquo;d moved his hand into my shorts, but the rest was focused on riding the wave of orgasm to its fullest extent. </p>
<p  >I took several shuddering breaths, feeling the last twitch calm itself. &ldquo;Damn, that was fast!&rdquo; He pulled his hand out and shook the white goop off onto the floor, rubbing the rest onto the sheets. He laughed a little, adding in a low tone, &ldquo;I can see the appeal of makin&rsquo; you do it yourself&mdash;you look good when you come.&rdquo;  </p>
<p  >Huh. <em>That</em> is something I don&rsquo;t hear often. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered  &mdash;&rdquo;   I panted, still letting my breath slow down, &ldquo;&mdash;you think so.&rdquo; My eyes were drawn to the &lt;&gt;tenting in his pants. I let my mouth curl up in a smirk as I returned my gaze to his face and undid his pants. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out how <em>you</em> orgasm, shall we?&rdquo; Jimmy licked his lips, and I snickered when I pulled his pants down, revealing briefs that were being strained to their utmost. &ldquo;Not a boxers kinda guy, Jimmy-boy?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t bother listening to his answer, instead just pulling the band down so he was exposed. He hummed appreciatively when I began circling the head with my thumb. I used my other hand to start stroking the shaft, but I kept my eye mostly on his face. Despite my best efforts, my memories of &lsquo;sex&rsquo; with Petey have remained firmly lodged in place, and what always bothers me&mdash;especially looking back&mdash;are his expressions. He&rsquo;d, understandably, rarely looked like he was enjoying himself. When he did it was always in tandem with fear, or anger, or pity, or shame. </p>
<p  >Jimmy was the exact opposite. His whole face was flushed by now, and it had spread to his neck and shoulders. I gave one of my hands a quick break to feel how tense his inner thighs had gotten; very, as it turned out. Brushing against some of his pubic hair, I noticed that it was actually red. That knowledge made me extremely giddy for some reason. He was also moaning shamelessly, shifting his weight into my hand with an, &ldquo;Mmm, <em>fuck</em>, Gary~&rdquo; Ho boy, the way he said my name&hellip; I&rsquo;d never heard anything that hot in my life. As I sped up my pumping, I focused intently on his face. Damn, that boy read like a  <em> book </em> . &ldquo;<em>Shiiiit&mdash;</em>yeah, <em>right</em> there...&rdquo; He never opened his eyes, but sometimes he&rsquo;d throw his head back and let out a particularly loud moan or expletive. Otherwise, he kept his head a little bowed, squeezing his eyes shut, biting his lip, poking his tongue out. At some point his thrusting into my hand gained a more urgent speed and he leaned forward, gritting his teeth. &ldquo;GOD&mdash;Gary, <em>please!</em> Ehhhh..&rdquo; He was <em>begging</em>. I felt my now-limp dick twitch at that, but there was time enough for that later. I re-focused on the task   at hand  , seeing what movements made his muscles tense, hitched his breath, produced those delicious <em>sounds</em>. Not long after, his whole body loosened and he threw his head back. &ldquo;Ah fucking<strong>hell</strong>  !  &rdquo; Suddenly, my chest was splattered with white fluid. He let out a whoosh of air before he grinned at me. &ldquo;You little <em>tease</em>,&rdquo; I shrugged&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t even realized I was doing it, honestly. </p>
<p  >He frowned a bit when he saw the mess, though. &ldquo;Oh, shit&hellip; sorry, dude&mdash;didn&rsquo;t mean to..&rdquo; As he was talking I ran a finger through it, raising it to my mouth and licking it, never breaking eye-contact. &ldquo;&hellip;  oh. Um.   &lsquo;kay, then..&rdquo; I smirked. I didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;he&rsquo;d <em>liked</em> it, and if that meant I got covered in bodily fluids who gave a shit? I wrapped my arms around him to pull him closer, but he braced his palms against my shoulders and pushed me away. &ldquo;I, uh, kinda don&rsquo;t wanna be covered in jizz, man.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I laughed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it <em>yours</em>, moron?&rdquo; He rolled his eyes, shifting so he was sitting down next to me and catching his breath. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Well yeah, but it&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s a shower around here or anything....&rdquo; I scoffed, watching the flush of his skin fade a bit. <em>Showers</em>? Since when does <em>Hopkins</em> concern himself with personal hygiene? </p>
<p  >I sneered, asking, &ldquo;Pft, what would you need a shower for anyway?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He rolled his eyes as he tucked himself back into his underwear. &ldquo;  Well I  &rsquo;m not gonna walk around smelling like I just fuckin&rsquo; dunked myself in cum.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I turned myself so I was facing him, threading my hands on his far shoulder and pulling him closer so I could run my tongue along the shell of his ear, making my voice as husky as I could. &ldquo;Now, who said <em>anything</em> about going outside?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He shivered at my tongue, but elbowed me away with a laugh, shooting me an incredulous look. &ldquo;Geez, dude, chill out, okay? We can get back to that after food and stuff,&rdquo; He got up and started pulling his pants up, snickering as he added, &ldquo;And I thought <em>Eunice</em> was thirsty, damn dude!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Har, har, har; very funny,&rdquo; Though now that he mentioned it, I <em>was</em> thirsty. &hellip;literally. I smacked my lips, trying to remember the last time I&rsquo;d drank something before my train of thought was interrupted by something damp hitting my face. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Here, wipe yourself down some&mdash;then we can go eat,&rdquo; It turned out to be a rag. I swiped it over my chest, wiping most of the mess up. I could feel my brain restarting my higher functions one-by-one. Reason: back online. I frowned when I came to my own boxers&mdash;they were pretty far-gone. I finally rolled off the mattress, tugging my pants off. &ldquo;Not sure where Pete&rsquo;s gonna be, but&hellip;&rdquo; Oh shit, I&rsquo;d forgotten about him.. Well, kind of&hellip; I padded over to my box of clothes, digging around for underwear. For all I knew he could show up at any minute, and I did <em>not</em> want to smell like semen around Petey. Jimmy shrugged his shirt on, saying, &ldquo;He probably stuck nearby, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to find &lsquo;im.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I nodded thoughtfully, ignoring my newly-reawakened growling stomach. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say he&rsquo;d be back soon?&rdquo; I scanned the room&mdash;did anything make it obvious what happened? My eyes fell on the stain Jimmy&rsquo;d wiped off onto the sheets. It was hardly visible&mdash;white on white, after all. On the other hand, experience has taught me that people <em>always</em> notice the one thing you don&rsquo;t want them to. </p>
<p  >Jimmy blew a raspberry as he pulled his vest over his head. &ldquo;Preeetty sure he was just saying that so you wouldn&rsquo;t freak out,&rdquo; I found a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, mulling those words as I pulled them over my head. So, Jimmy thought he wouldn&rsquo;t be by soon? That was good, at least&mdash;he knows this Petey better than I do. I glanced over in time to see him pull his collar through the vest as he added, &ldquo;I mean, I said he &lsquo;probly didn&rsquo;t need to stay away <em>that</em> long&hellip; but if I were him I&rsquo;d wanna be on the safe side, ya know?&rdquo; I had no idea what that meant. Probably nothing&mdash;those two have their own inside jokes I&rsquo;ll never understand, after all. </p>
<p  >I went back to rooting around for shoes and socks, instead asking, &ldquo;Why do you do that with your collar?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy gave me a whut-wat-duh as he knelt to tie his laces. &ldquo;&hellip;Do what with it? You mean, turn it up?&rdquo; I nodded. He looked thoughtful for a second as he finished before shrugging. &ldquo;Dunno. I didn&rsquo;t normally wear collared shirts before the time travel bs anyhow, not since&hellip;&rdquo; he pondered for a moment. &ldquo;&hellip;shit, since fourth grade,&rdquo; He shrugged, pushing himself up to stand. &ldquo;The kids I hung out with popped their collars, I guess,&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t reply; I barely know anything about his pre-loop history. I&rsquo;d never had much reason to learn about it, after all. </p>
<p  >I finally finished putting my shoes on and went to meet him at the foot of the stairs. If we could meet Petey elsewhere, he wouldn&rsquo;t need to see the stain anyhow. Jimmy fell into step next to me as we went up the stairs to the shop, continuing his &lsquo;story&rsquo; without prompt. &ldquo;They probably thought it was cool from some TV show they saw. It was a pretty sheltered town&mdash;kinda like Bullworth, actually&mdash; &lsquo;cept wayyy less shitty,&rdquo; He laughed as he walked past the attendant into the shop proper. </p>
<p  >I snorted, saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly an achievement,&rdquo; He laughed as we exited the shop. I avoided eye-contact by scanning the street for Petey. I was a little surprised by how dark it was&mdash;how long had I been asleep? Last I remembered it had been&hellip; four thirty in the morning. </p>
<p  >We didn&rsquo;t speak for a while before Jimmy commented, &ldquo;So where didj&rsquo;ya wanna eat?&rdquo; My stomach growled at mention of food&mdash;sigh. Stupid biological needs. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Mexican Restaurant&rsquo;,&rdquo; which Jimmy made sure to put in air quotes. &ldquo;&hellip;and that diner. &lsquo;sokay, I guess,&rdquo; He frowned, saying to himself, &ldquo;Food&rsquo;s a lot better in the Vale.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shrugged. &ldquo;Food is food; whatever&rsquo;s closest is fine. Besides, Petey&rsquo;s more likely to be around here.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He grunted in agreement with the second statement, but talked about the food as he headed off, me close behind. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the guy who&rsquo;s spent a gazillion years eating food at fuckin&rsquo; Bullworth Academy,&rdquo; He shuddered, opening the door to the diner. &ldquo;How do you even <em>eat</em> that stuff?&rdquo; I quirked an eyebrow as I followed him into the noisy space. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s poisonous,&rdquo; The movement of people and clatter of dishes and conversation was a little overwhelming after the quiet of the shop and street, but Jimmy started heading purposefully in one direction, so I followed. Turned out he&rsquo;d spotted Petey&mdash;he was sitting at the counter, and some Greaser was talking to him. </p>
<p  >Jimmy slapped him on the back and said, &ldquo;Hey man!&rdquo; Then he held up a hand for a high-five, sporting a huge grin. &ldquo;Eyyy?&rdquo; I frowned as I put my hands in my pockets, looking between the two of them. That sounded like some pickup-artist&rsquo;s horrible greeting. </p>
<p  >Petey rolled his eyes, but accepted the high-five before turning to the Greaser and saying, &ldquo;Sorry, what were you saying?&rdquo; I started, doing a double take to get a closer look at who he had been talking to. I narrowed my eyes&mdash;the one that constantly bitches about his girlfriend? What was <em>he</em> doing talking to Femme Boy of all people? </p>
<p  >He slid off the stool, saying, &ldquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s cool! I got this thing, ya know? Hey, what&rsquo;d ya say yer name was?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey got off his stool as well and offered a handshake with his signature cavity-inducing sweet smile. &ldquo;Pete Kowalski&mdash;it was nice to meet you&hellip; Ricky?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >The Greaser nodded as he accepted the handshake &ldquo;Cool! Talk to ya later!&rdquo; and headed out. </p>
<p  >Petey made a victory fist-pump, &ldquo;Yes! Remembered his name!&rdquo; before walking over to an empty booth. &ldquo;Come on, I haven&rsquo;t ordered yet.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I narrowed my eyes, looking out the door that &lsquo;Ricky&rsquo; had just left through. &ldquo;What was that all about?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Oh, he was just telling me about the bikes he works on,&rdquo; I slipped into a booth by the window, Jimmy next to me and Petey sitting across from us. &ldquo;Did you know that bicycles are the most fuel-efficient transportation humans have ever made?&rdquo; He looked inordinately happy when he said that for some reason. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Since when do <em>you</em> care about bikes, Femme Boy?&rdquo; He shrugged, and I had a horrifying thought. &ldquo;Oh <em>God</em>, you&rsquo;re not going to start wearing hair product and horrible leather, are you?&rdquo; He just rolled his eyes as a waiter set down menus for us. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Come on, just &lsquo;cuz I&rsquo;m not interested in something doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s no point in learning about it, right?&rdquo; I was too busy gulping my water down to reply, but the waiter cleared her throat and stopped our conversation anyway. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Hello, welcome to the Happy Diner! I&rsquo;m Jenny, and I&rsquo;ll be your host for tonight. Please, let me know if you have any questions.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I held out the menu that&rsquo;d been placed in front of me, saying &ldquo;Five pb&amp;js.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >The waiter nodded, accepting my menu with only a small strange look. &ldquo;Certainly, sir. Do you gentlemen know what you&rsquo;d like to drink?&rdquo; Petey ordered a shake and Jimmy a large soda before Petey made sure to thank her as she left and they started perusing their menus. I propped my head up so I could look out the window, drumming my fingers. It really was dark&mdash;the streetlamps and car headlights were the only things illuminating the sidewalk outside as townsfolk and kids wandered past. According to my watch, it was quarter after nine. I furrowed my brow, doing some quick estimation in my head&mdash;the time between me waking up and Jimmy and I leaving the store had been a half-hour at the most, and fifteen to twenty minutes felt much more likely. I sighed; that really <em>had</em> been fast. I leaned back, my gaze shifting to the moron as he and Femme Boy discussed what was good at this place. </p>
<p  >There wasn&rsquo;t any sign of what had just happened on him&mdash;his hair is too short to be messed up and his clothing is always so wrinkled anyway that there wasn&rsquo;t a significant difference. He seemed to notice my eyes on him, because he turned my way and winked at me. I stiffened, looking across the table at Femme Boy. Had he seen anything? But he smiled, pushing his menu away as he said, &ldquo;  Sooo...  <em> that </em>  went a lot faster than I expected&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy suddenly hooked his arm in mine and leaned against me, his arms folded. The cocky smirk was evident in his next sentence. &ldquo;What can I say, I&rsquo;m just that good.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey laughed. &ldquo;Yeah, <em>suuuure</em> you are, Jimmy!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He shrugged, unfolding his arms and throwing one on my shoulder casually, but that made me curious. &ldquo;Hey, why <em>did</em> you leave so fast, Petey?&rdquo; He blinked. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Uhhhh.. well I wasn&rsquo;t going to <em>stay</em>&hellip;&rdquo; His face took on the old disgust from <em>that</em> month. Wait&hellip; He added quickly, &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;m happy you guys had fun, but I didn&rsquo;t really want to, uh, see anyt  &mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >My eyes widened, and I interrupted him. &ldquo;Wait&hellip;&rdquo; I backed away from Jimmy, looking between the two of them. &ldquo;You.. you <em>knew</em>  ?  &rdquo; Their eyes met with the signature &lsquo;man, is Gary insane or what&rsquo; look before Jimmy turned to me. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What, that we were probably gonna make out? &lsquo;Course Pete knew, dude&mdash;whadya <em>think</em> I did when I kissed ya the first time?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Now, how am <em>I</em> supposed to know that?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey cleared his throat, grabbing our attention. &ldquo;Here, allow me to quote Jimmy directly.&rdquo; He then lowered the timbre of his voice a couple of octaves. &ldquo;&lsquo;Dude, I totally made out with Gary today! It so fuckin&rsquo; hot, man. High-five!&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&nbsp;He shot Jimmy a smug look, who held up a finger as if to object, before lowering it and shrugging. &ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s pretty much what happened,&rdquo; He looked at my horrified expression and leaned away from me, adding, &ldquo;Come on, it&rsquo;s not like I gave &lsquo;im a play-by-play!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t get the usual report that time,&rdquo;  <em> Usual report </em> !? </p>
<p  >The waiter came back and set down a plate of sandwiches, &ldquo;So, are you ready to or&mdash;&rdquo; but I interrupted her. &ldquo;Ahahaha what, does Jimmy <em>usually</em> regale you with every <em>detail</em> of his sexual encounters?&rdquo; All three people at the table widened their eyes at that. </p>
<p  >The general din of the restaurant kept the silence from being too awkward, and after a moment the waiter said uncertainly, &ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ll&hellip; just&hellip; come back when you&rsquo;re ready, then?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey responded first, saying frantically, &ldquo;No, no, we&rsquo;re ready! Oh my gosh, we&rsquo;re <em>so</em>   sorry!  &rdquo; &lt;what is even the point of this&gt; </p>
<p  >Jimmy followed it up by punching me in the shoulder and adding, &ldquo;Just ignore him, he&rsquo;s a fucking prick,&rdquo; I flinched at the punch. At least he&rsquo;d stopped putting his arm on my shoulder which, while pleasant, was rather confusing. I instead occupied myself with dragging the plate toward me and digging in while the two of them ordered. I don&rsquo;t usually care about food or its flavor, but pb&amp;j has always been a favorite of mine for some reason. I guess it makes me feel nostalgic, though for what I&rsquo;m not sure. As she left, they turned back to me. Jimmy hissed, &ldquo;What the <em>hell</em>, man!? She doesn&rsquo;t wanna fuckin&rsquo; know about that!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Oh dear, Hopkins; you seem to have mistaken me for someone who <em>gives</em> a shit,&rdquo; I snorted, talking around a bite of my sandwich. &ldquo;You seem perfectly fine talking about that with <em>Petey</em>, of all people,&rdquo; I gestured casually in his direction with the food in my hand. </p>
<p  >He was looking between us awkwardly, and when our focus shifted to him he held up his hands. &ldquo;Whoa, hey! It&rsquo;s not that big a deal&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it normal for people to talk about that with their friends?&rdquo; He was looking at me in mild confusion, but like he was still trying to understand what was happening in my brain. Of course, typical Femme Boy. </p>
<p  >Jimmy nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Yeah, see man? No biggie! And hey, I won&rsquo;t kiss and tell with <em>you</em>&hellip;&rdquo; Here he moved closer to my ear and said in a low, quiet voice, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be our little  <em> secret </em> , hmm?  &rdquo; I shoved him away as quickly as I could, avoiding looking in Petey&rsquo;s direction. How could he do that <em>in front of him</em>  !? </p>
<p  >&ldquo;OhmyGodJimmyshutthefuckup!&rdquo; Jimmy didn&rsquo;t look upset by my sudden hostility&mdash;if anything he <em>lit up</em> at my words. </p>
<p  >But he backed off, saying, &ldquo;Heh, okay, okay; sorry man,&rdquo; Petey was drinking a milkshake that had suddenly appeared, but he looked like he was smiling&mdash;I relaxed a little at that, resuming my eating and drinking. The next hour was spent chatting aimlessly. It felt&hellip; nice. It brought back those early days after I stopped caring about taking over the school but before things got creepy with Petey. Of afternoons spent hanging out and playing Smash, or Jimmy and I convincing Petey to come with us to smash up one of the prepies&rsquo; houses, or trying to quietly argue over who could eat the popcorn during a movie and being repeatedly shushed. </p>
<p  >I kept my eye on Jimmy&mdash;he and Petey kept up the bulk of the conversation. He doesn&rsquo;t listen with the attentiveness that Petey has, but there was a shift from before. Usually when I would talk he would use it as an excuse to interrupt or insult me. The insults had been far less biting lately, but now he just made comments the way the Jimmy I&rsquo;d known would. It was like the aggression that had colored all of his interactions with me for the last loop or so had just&hellip; drained away. I turned toward the comic shop as soon as we left the building, intent on sitting and thinking by myself, but Petey said, &ldquo;Hey, where&rsquo;re you going?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy wrapped himself around my arm and pulled me away, adding &ldquo;Yeah man, school&rsquo;s this way?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I frowned, attempting to pull away as I said &ldquo;I think I <em>know</em> where the school is, moron.&rdquo; But I couldn&rsquo;t escape his grip, and was instead dragged away from my destination. </p>
<p  >Petey laughed a little nervously as we walked. &ldquo;Come on Gary, you&rsquo;ve been holed up in that shop for, like, five days.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy nodded solemnly as he loosened his grip until he was just pulling me by the hand. &ldquo;Yeah, man&mdash;the dorkiness fumes in there are gonna get to you if you stay there for too long,&rdquo; I think Petey said something about that line, but I was too busy focusing on the fact that he was <em>holding</em> my <em>hand</em>. &lt;I instinctively tried to pull away, but he just tighened his grip.&gt; I forced myself to look away, alternately concentrating on not moving my hand and trying to not stare. His grip had that same comforting warmth as his chest had. As we passed the &lsquo;Mexican Restaurant&rsquo;, I shifted so that the grip was a little less awkward and noted he had a lot of callouses&mdash;a nuance that had been rather lost on me when his hands were down my pants. I flashed on that &lsquo;first&rsquo; time with Petey, when I&rsquo;d held his hand to get him to follow me; and on the gore of said hand from so long ago. It really had been a bad injury; had he needed to get surgery? As we walked over the bridge I risked a few seconds of scrutinizing Jimmy&rsquo;s hand. I hadn&rsquo;t ever seen the bones of his hand specifically, but&hellip; I had certainly seen him with serious enough injuries that would provide my six-year old self with proof he was human. Well&hellip; not this Jimmy. The other Jimmy, the one I knew. As we passed through the gate to the campus, suddenly the many times I&rsquo;d murdered him in The Hole swam back into my brain. I tightened my grip automatically; I hadn&rsquo;t thought about <em>that</em> since&hellip; shit, since the Road Trip. </p>
<p  >I was snapped out of my reverie when Petey yawned and said &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;m beat&mdash;night, guys. See ya tomorrow,&rdquo; As he did so he waved, turning toward the stairwell in the dorm. Huh, when had we gotten here? </p>
<p  >Jimmy said sleepily &ldquo;Yeah, Pete, &lsquo;night&rdquo; And walked into his dorm room, me in tow. I pulled my hand out of his grasp, which wasn&rsquo;t difficult since it&rsquo;d gotten quite slack. But he turned around when I did. &ldquo;Hey, c&rsquo;mon&mdash;where ya goin&rsquo;  ?  &rdquo; He walked up to me, grabbing both my hands with his and moving back into his room. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;chya wanna have some <em>fun</em>  ?  &rdquo; His tone made me shiver. He must&rsquo;ve noticed, because he chuckled. &ldquo;Heh, yeah ya do~&rdquo; I licked my lips as I let myself be pulled into his room. I guess if he was offering, I wasn&rsquo;t about to turn it down. He started circling his arms around my waist and kissing me much more slowly than before. In between, he asked kind of quietly &ldquo;So you wanna tell me about some &lsquo;a the <em>other</em> fantasies you were havin&rsquo;  ?  &rdquo; He sat down on the bed so that I was kneeling on top of him, and he slipped his hands under my shirt instead of kissing me again, letting me respond. </p>
<p  >I thought about it for a bit as he pulled my shirt off. &ldquo;Well you liked shoving me around,&rdquo; I started helping him get his shirt off, adding almost absently &ldquo;Fantasy-you was rather&hellip;  <em> aggressive </em> ,&rdquo; Ha, talk about understatement. </p>
<p  >He laughed a bit quietly, balling his vest up and throwing it behind me as I helped with the buttons on his shirt. &ldquo;  Dunno if I  &rsquo;m up for that, sorry&hellip;&rdquo; I scanned him as he reached up to rub his hand over one of his eyes, weighing my options while he yawned. I wanted to have more sex&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t tired, and I knew I&rsquo;d spend all night wandering around evading cops if I left, so I would&rsquo;ve loved to stay and actually get some sleep, for once. On the other hand&hellip; I recalled the first night of the Road Trip&mdash;how I&rsquo;d used Petey&rsquo;s own sleep against him, ensuring he&rsquo;d have an erection against his will. I shuddered, and not in a good way. </p>
<p  >I pressed my face against Jimmy&rsquo;s, wrapping my arms around his shoulders. I muttered &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; And I really didn&rsquo;t. I was in his bed at his invitation&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t care what we did at this point. I pulled back, moving to get off the bed. Guess I was in for a night of dodging the cops. </p>
<p  >But he reached out and grabbed my arm. &ldquo;Hey, that doesn&rsquo;t mean ya gotta <em>go</em>&mdash;we can just keep it low key,&rdquo; He let go as soon as I stopped moving away, moving to take his shoes off. &ldquo;&lsquo;Sides, don&rsquo;t you sleep better with somebody?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t respond, just sat down next to him and kicked my own shoes off. I couldn&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d remembered that. He kicked his pants off, and moved so he was further back on the bed before letting himself fall onto his back and stretch out. &ldquo;So wha&rsquo;dya wanna do?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shrugged, turning toward him so my legs weren&rsquo;t dangling off the side of the bed. &ldquo;You seem pretty tired,&rdquo; He nodded, closing his eyes and sighing. I watched him breathe for a bit. He&rsquo;s a lot more muscular than Petey, even post-boxing; he isn&rsquo;t called Femme Boy for nothing, after all. Jimmy falls more on the &lsquo;built&rsquo; side of things than Petey, with a harder line to his stomach than Petey&rsquo;s softer belly. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Like what you see?&rdquo; I flicked my gaze back up to his face, which had turned to me with a bit of a smirk, despite the drooping lids. I nodded, not changing my neutral expression. He frowned a bit, rolling onto his side and crawling my way. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t very enthusiastic&hellip;&rdquo; he plopped down next to me, head supported on his hand. &ldquo;what&rsquo;chya thinkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >As I scanned his face, the memory of when I <em>first</em> murdered him resurfaced. I had waited for him on one of the islands in the inlet, knowing when he&rsquo;d be out there. There&rsquo;d been far more blood than I had expected, at the time. I flinched, looking away. I haven't thought about that in decades.... &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; I heard him sigh, and sit up before he suddenly pushed me down by my shoulders so I was lying down before rolling on top of me. </p>
<p  >He crossed his arms across my chest, laying his head on them before saying &ldquo;Man, you&rsquo;re such a fuckin&rsquo;   weirdo,  &rdquo; I shrugged, ignoring the way his warmth reminded me of how warm his blood is&mdash;had been. Was. He smiled back, moving himself forward with his arms a little to kiss me before shifting off my stomach. He yawned, and began nuzzling my neck and  <em> spooning </em>  me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty cuddly for someone who&rsquo;s so boney&hellip;&rdquo; What the hell was I supposed to say to that? I didn&rsquo;t reply, just felt his breathing level out for a while, letting the even rhythm put me to sleep. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~ Chapter 24: Suddenly Buttsex~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yeah, did you hear? That new kid died!&rdquo; Cold seeps into my bones at the words, spoken so callously by somebody, I don&rsquo;t notice or care who. &ldquo;I dunno&mdash;maybe the hospital?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I&rsquo;m by his side, kneeling to scan his body. The cold is even worse beneath the school. I watch the blood darken the blue of his sweater until it&rsquo;s leeched away by the film of running water on the bottom of the basin. I&rsquo;ve seen this hundreds of times before, so the metallic tang of blood in the air is horrifying in its mundanity. Behind me, I hear a soft &ldquo;Jimmy?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Spinning around, I&rsquo;m shocked to see Petey standing by the TV&mdash;I drop the knife in my hand and back up, but I can still feel the wetness on my hands and upper arms. Desperately, I try to explain. &ldquo;No, I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean, he was just&hellip; I just heard from somebody&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey doesn&rsquo;t seem to hear me. He moves forward and stares down at Jimmy sadly before sighing resignedly. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s not much of a surprise, huh?&rdquo; Then, knife suddenly hand, he begins rolling his shirtsleeves up. His voice turns bitter and scathing as he adds, &ldquo;I mean honestly, Gary. You don&rsquo;t think I actually forgot what you did, do you?&rdquo; I want to turn around, grab him, scream, <em>something</em>, but it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m forcing myself to do fucking nothing as Petey draws a line of quickly-welling red down his arm. He&rsquo;s utterly calm as he does it, but the next moment he collapses in the sand next to Jimmy. </p>
<p  >Suddenly I&rsquo;m allowed to move again and I scramble through the sandy shallows to get to them. But there&rsquo;s nothing to do but stare and hate myself as I watch the life drain out of his arm and mix with Jimmy&rsquo;s before being swept away by the harbor. </p>
<p  >It&rsquo;s the moment that I realize I can still kind of smell Jimmy&mdash;rather than a corpse&mdash;where I can finally force my eyes open. </p>
<p  >In movies and what-not, people having nightmares always catapult out of bed, breathing heavily and probably sweating profusely. That never happens to me. I have to claw my way out of the dream, fight tooth and nail to escape back into reality. I swallowed, curling up a little as I remembered the details; for a moment I panicked at the memory of Petey saying something about what I had done. It had felt so <em>real</em>, I was half-convinced it was true even though I knew full well that it was just my stupid paranoia. I shook my head a little&mdash;what I needed was a distraction, and quickly. </p>
<p  >Through the dark, I could sense the body that had helped wake me quietly breathing&mdash;the rhythmic pressure change gave me something to focus on as I tried to calm down and not immediately go into a thought-spiral of how if Petey could remember he would tell Jimmy and if he told Jimmy they would leave and never tell me where they were going&lt;&gt;. Calm enough now to know that I wasn&rsquo;t going to try and run to Petey&rsquo;s room and apologize, I turned around so I was facing Jimmy and began lightly kissing his face; it had only been a week or so, but he had invited me to sleep with him practically every other night. The trembling eased a bit as I felt the warmth of an obviously-not-dead Jimmy. Rolling him onto his front, I began flicking my tongue over him as I straddled his lower back. He mumbled unintelligibly for a little bit while I licked the heated flesh. In the meantime, I ran my hands lightly over his back before moving down to his butt. Slowly tugging the band of his sweats down I marveled again at just how badly I want him&mdash;in all those centuries I&rsquo;d spent around Jimmy I had never even wanted to look at his body, much less run my hands over it the way I was now. A preliminary pass said nothing out of the ordinary; his butt isn&rsquo;t particularly large, or muscular, or soft. It was the person attached to the butt that I was interested in&mdash;so, I sat up and began playing with him more decisively, seeing just how far apart I could spread him before he noticed. </p>
<p  >I smirked in satisfaction when I felt him tense up before I flashed on an early Road Trip test run; his shirt had been off for some reason, and I&rsquo;d been in an.. experimental mood. I could hear myself sneer, &ldquo;Try that again, moron&hellip;&rdquo; over his screaming. &ldquo;&hellip;and I&rsquo;ll cut off more than an earlobe,&rdquo; Bile rose in my throat, but I swallowed it. I walked my hands up his back and laid down on top of him, repressing the urge to bury my face between his shoulder blades and mumble apologies he couldn&rsquo;t hear and wouldn&rsquo;t understand. Instead, I utilized the few inches I had over him to grind the growing bulge in my boxers against him. Putting my mouth next to his ear, I whispered lustily, &ldquo;Sorry Jimmy-boy, your ass just wouldn&rsquo;t let me sleep,&rdquo; He began moaning more readily, and it was sounding less like sleep deprivation and more like sex. I could even let myself believe for a second that I really had just been horney instead of desperate to stop myself doing something stupid. </p>
<p  >A few moments later he let out a decidedly sinful groan and shifted in a circle against me that made me tighten my grip on his side because holy <em>hell</em> that was fucking hot. Even as I began breathing heavily and humping his crack I heard him chuckle; I couldn&rsquo;t see his expression, but I could hear the smile in his voice even though it was thick with sleep. &ldquo;God, you are such a <em>slut</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shuddered with pleasure at the insult, peppering his back with little bites and licks and kisses while maintaining the rhythmic motion against him. &ldquo;Oh, am I?&rdquo; I kept my voice as even as I could, hoping he was too tired to tell how sporadic I was being. </p>
<p  >Jimmy laughed a little as he let his head droop, adding, &ldquo;Heh, I fucking love it.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I switched to nipping and light flicks of my tongue to respond. &ldquo;Just so long&mdash;as we&rsquo;re not&mdash;picking out curtains&mdash;or anything,&rdquo; Planting one final kiss right above his tail bone, I took a moment to take a deep breath as I pulled back. It was time to focus; nobody ever pleased their partner by not paying attention to their responses, and it would give me something to focus on instead of&hellip; </p>
<p  >I reached for the bottle of lotion that was on the end-table, quickly squirting some onto my hand. The texture wasn&rsquo;t anything like blood. Focusing on the differences as I coated my palms helped with trying to pretend like I had some semblance of control. Jimmy, ever the oblivious idiot, snickered at my glib tone. &ldquo;Pft, think I give a shit what the curtains look like in this dump?&rdquo; Until I ran my hands between his crack, and I heard a sharp intake of air. &ldquo;Ooooh fuuck!&rdquo; He laid his head down on the pillow as his arms started gripping one another. As I slowed down, I slid my free hand between his legs to massage his balls a little&mdash;all the while rhythmically massaging the ring of muscle. It was tight at first, but as I stroked his shaft he relaxed. </p>
<p  >He&rsquo;d managed to loosen up over the couple of minutes I had been playing with him, so I was able to get my tongue pretty deep before he abruptly and inexplicably closed up. &ldquo;GAH! Wha&ndash;holy shit, dude, hold on!&rdquo; I blinked in surprise as he quickly flipped himself around so I found myself looking at his raging hard-on as he sat up, breathing heavily. I flicked my gaze up to his face, and I could just make out his expression: a cross between &lsquo;horny teenager&rsquo; and &lsquo;awkward teenager&rsquo;. &ldquo;Dude as hot as that is, shit&rsquo;s kinda dangerous; don&rsquo;t wanna get a disease or something, ya know?&rdquo; Was he <em>serious</em>? I rolled my eyes&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake, with the time loops we literally had nothing to worry about! Still, I sighed and shrugged in acceptance; I certainly had no business arguing with him about it. Smirking, I leaned downward further, licking his tip&mdash;we still had plenty of options. But despite the delicious groan he let out at the contact, he pushed me away <em>again</em>. &ldquo;Fucking hell Gary, you just had your <em>tongue</em> in my <em>ass</em>!&rdquo; I glared at him as I could practically hear him roll his eyes. &ldquo;Anal 101&mdash;keep butt germs away from dick germs, sheesh,&rdquo; He crawled over to his nightstand as I tried to keep myself from strangling him. </p>
<p  >For fuck&rsquo;s sake, we&rsquo;d done nothing but make out and jerk each other off! Luckily, I caught myself scowling and shook my head to clear my expression&mdash;it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m Jimmy&rsquo;s only option. I don&rsquo;t want anybody else (who wants me back), but he&rsquo;d made it clear that whatever this&hellip; thing is, it&rsquo;s purely casual. The other day he&rsquo;d <em>waved</em> to me when I saw him making out with one of the cheerleaders. Honestly, Jimmy has the attention span of a golden retriever&mdash;and I have the maturity to admit that it bugs me that he isn&rsquo;t mine alone. Especially because it&rsquo;s the same losers I know like the back of my hand; it&rsquo;s like he doesn&rsquo;t even appreciate how lucky he is that I want him! Hell, knowing Jimmy like I do, he&rsquo;ll stop being into me, probably soon, so I&rsquo;m trying to ensure that moment happens later rather than sooner by making myself as available as humanly possible when he&rsquo;s horny. Which is a <em>lot</em>; we&rsquo;re talking about somebody who regularly masturbates twice a day, and thrice isn&rsquo;t uncommon. A little ridiculous if you ask me, but it&rsquo;s hardly my job to judge him for it. He now came crawling back and sat down before ripping the wrapping for something open. &ldquo;I mean if you really wanna you can just put this on me,&rdquo; Before holding out a.. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;&hellip;A condom?&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t possibly be serious. Right? </p>
<p  >But it seemed like, indeed, Jimmy Hopkins, Slut King of Bullworth, was actually <em>asking</em> me to put a condom on him <em>before</em> sucking his dick. &ldquo;Well yeah. I don&rsquo;t wanna get fucking AIDS from my own butt or something.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >For a moment I couldn&rsquo;t process this information. &ldquo;&hellip;there is so much wrong with that statement I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin....&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy rolled his eyes and tossed the condom my way. &ldquo;Whatever dude, I just don&rsquo;t wanna get some fucking disease.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I sighed deeply. &ldquo;One, you don&rsquo;t &lsquo;get AIDS&rsquo; from something, AIDS is like the shitty stage of HIV disease. Two, if your butt has HIV, then your dick already has it too. Three, you&rsquo;re not going to get something from me <em>orally</em>&mdash;if anything, I&rsquo;ll probably contract something from you, not pass it on.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >A brief silence followed this outburst. Eventually, Jimmy snorted and started snickering. &ldquo;Dude, you can totally pass stuff in oral! I mean I dunno about AIDS specifically but I&rsquo;m pretty sure licking a regular &lsquo;ol cock can give you <em>some</em> kinda gross disease.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I&rsquo;ll admit I was rather short on patience. It was early, and I was tired, and I was fucking wired by that dream. &ldquo;Oh, so sorry, didn&rsquo;t know I was talking to the fucking Safe Sex Expert of Bullworth!&rdquo; I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Jimmy Hopkins is <em>surely</em> the paragon of cleanliness and safety in his sexual escapades.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy groaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sayin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m some kinda expert, I just know that licking a fucking penis without a condom is just asking to get some kinda STD or whatever!&rdquo; I scooted forward and pressed my knee between his legs. &ldquo;Aaahfuckk&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Perfect. &ldquo;Okay, then I&rsquo;ll just continue what I was doing, shall I?&rdquo; I pushed his shoulders so he was lying down. After coating my hand in saliva, I ran it over his entrance again. He&rsquo;d tightened back up, but that was nothing a little distraction couldn&rsquo;t fix. Only one hand on a dick isn&rsquo;t terribly efficient (especially when it&rsquo;s my left), but it was enough that I could feel the ring of muscle under my hand relax a bit. </p>
<p  >Personally, I don&rsquo;t particularly like the physical part of giving. Leaning down to run the flat of my tongue around where I was fingering him wasn&rsquo;t all that enjoyable by itself. It was the &ldquo;GaryIsweartofuckingGOoood&rdquo; that sent a crackle of heat down my spine. Add to that feeling him get even harder in my hand, and that mental stimulation was as potent as any lick. I pulled back, just focusing on massaging his hole for a bit while I traced a line down his raphe with my nose. &ldquo;Goddam&hellip; <em>Gary</em>!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I grinned at him as he glared at me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not licking anything, moron..&rdquo; I blew a bit on his tip which made him shudder and, consequently, draw my fingers deeper in. As he moaned and squirmed, I could feel a familiar walnut-like lump, so I started massaging that. </p>
<p  >Unsurprisingly, a few moments into that Jimmy had tensed considerably. &ldquo;Ahhhhh fuck thatfeelsgreatholyshiiii<em>iiahhhh</em>&rdquo; Another interesting thing about Jimmy is he <em>never shuts up</em>. He&rsquo;s always saying something, vocalizing when others usually quiet down. Personally, I don&rsquo;t like being loud during sex&mdash;makes it feel more artificial, but it seems to come naturally to him. And I love it. Seeing him like this, squirming and moaning my name in near-delirium was like a confirmation; Right now, he was mine&mdash;it was my name he was moaning in pleasure, my hands sending blood to color his face and fill his cock, and we <em>both</em> knew it. Panting post-orgasm, he let out a long, &ldquo;Fuuuck&hellip;&rdquo; as I crawled up and laid down next to him. &ldquo;Jesus&hellip;&rdquo; He glanced at me before laughing. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known you were this good I&rsquo;d-a tried to get with ya way sooner!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >And something about the honesty in that statement caught me off guard. I opted to lean forward and shut him up with my mouth. It was easier that way. </p>
<p  >Unfortunately, he turned his head away, laughing a little. &ldquo;Dude! <em>Still</em> just had your tongue in my butt, man!&rdquo; Even so, he started wrapping his arms around me and burying his face into my neck. I closed my eyes and just let myself enjoy his warmth and slowing breathing. But a few seconds later, he sighed and let out a muffled &ldquo;Fuck, now you gotta go brush your teeth....&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I frowned. What? &ldquo;Why on earth would I do that?&rdquo; What business was it of his what I did? </p>
<p  >He snorted, but still pulled away as he said, &ldquo;We <em>kinda</em> just did something risky.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes and added under his breath, &ldquo;&hellip;And I&rsquo;m not about to let Pete get on my case about it again.&rdquo; He yawned and started pushing me off the bed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only take a couple minutes,&rdquo; before falling back onto the pillows. I swear, if Jimmy was ever trapped in the fucking apocalypse he&rsquo;d still sleep like a rock. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; I crawled over him to get out of bed, making sure to put my knee in his stomach. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a douche for blue-balling me, though.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He let out a, &ldquo;HUUUGH!&rdquo; before throwing plenty of expletives my way as I headed out. As I made my way downstairs to the bathrooms, I let my mind drift to the dream&mdash;now that I was fully awake, it had far less bite to it. Oddly enough, since I&rsquo;d started sleeping with Jimmy I had found falling asleep far easier, but I&rsquo;ve been remembering my dreams far more vividly than usual. I&rsquo;m not the type to think that correlation always equals causation, but the trend has been disturbing&hellip; but also enjoyable, in some ways. I frowned as I brushed, recalling one dream in particular from earlier in the week&mdash;it&rsquo;d been about Petey, Jimmy and I all&hellip; well, having sex <em>together</em>. I woke up with such a confused boner I&rsquo;d just hugged Jimmy until morning. </p>
<p  >Things had really been looking up recently, disturbing nightmares notwithstanding. I hadn&rsquo;t wanted to admit it to myself, but intentionally avoiding Petey (and Jimmy, to some extent) for nearly three years hadn&rsquo;t done my mental health any favors, if my breakdown over Jimmy was any indication. Pft; honestly. Sure, it wasn&rsquo;t as if I&rsquo;d been physically attracted to anybody other than Petey, but even I can admit when I&rsquo;m being an idiot. Speaking of Femme Boy, he&rsquo;d even invited me to go with them to his annual Christmas thing with his family&mdash;I had tried to get him to invite me to that for decades! And with this new Jimmy thing to deal with any sex-related desires, I didn&rsquo;t need to worry about what I might do to Petey. </p>
<p  >I frowned, automatically pressing myself close to Jimmy as I climbed back into bed. Things were going <em>too</em> well. It made me uneasy, like a loop where every single piece of a plan goes perfectly only for things to fall apart at the very last moment leaving me impaled to the ground for a few hours of torturous bleeding out. </p>
<p  >Still, the feeling of his heartbeat and breathing were hypnotic enough to let me stop thinking about it for a little while. Who knows, maybe I was just being paranoid; maybe things would go well from here on out.  </p>
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 25: Dragon Twister Wind~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >The winter wind made the house creek as I snuck out of Pete&rsquo;s room as quietly as I could; kinda annoying since I already suck at stealth, but eh. Ya gotta do what ya gotta do. Good thing I didn&rsquo;t have to go far&mdash;the guest room was right next door. I pressed my ear against the door, trying to listen for.. uh&hellip; shit, something? </p>
<p  >I shrugged and knocked kinda quietly. Maybe he&rsquo;d be listening; I whispered, &ldquo;Pst, Gary, it&rsquo;s m  &mdash;&rdquo;   but the door swung open before I was done. He must&rsquo;ve been waiting. As he closed it behind him I grinned, even though he probably couldn&rsquo;t see in the dark. &ldquo;Heh, great minds think alike, eh?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I would&rsquo;ve bet a <em>lot</em> of money that he rolled his eyes at that. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s more like &lsquo;horny teenagers think alike&rsquo;, moron,&rdquo; I snickered&mdash;fair point. Once I got to the stairs I heard him stage-whisper from up ahead, &ldquo;Careful&mdash;the second one squeaks,&rdquo; before I even had a chance to step down. He&rsquo;d already reached the bottom by the time I hit the landing, and thanks to the Christmas lights in the living room I got a real eyeful of his pissy expression. He was leaning against the wall and jiggling his leg impatiently, too. He whispered into the quiet, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;  s fine  &mdash;take your time, moron. I have absolutely nothing better I could be doing at this very moment.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I finally reached the bottom of the stairs, ignoring the dig. He was just being an asshole, like always. &ldquo;Aw but Gary, aren&rsquo;t I the only thing you wanna do?&rdquo; Heh, his leg stopped moving for juuuust a second before he moved to follow me down the hallway. It&rsquo;d been, like, a couple months since we&rsquo;d started this sex thing, and for my money it was working out pretty well. Now instead of fighting all the time we&rsquo;re fuckin&rsquo; all the time, and that&rsquo;s a definite improvement in my book. When we got to the next room I suddenly realized I actually had no idea where to go to mess around. &ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; Crap. </p>
<p  >Gary chuckled behind me. &ldquo;Aw, is the widdle moron lost? How <em>unusual</em>,&rdquo; He slipped his hand into mine as he passed, pulling us into the bathroom and shutting the door. It was real dark until he snapped the lights on, smirking. </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes before blinking a bunch at the bright light. &ldquo;Well aren&rsquo;t you fuckin&rsquo; smart,&rdquo; Now that the light was better, I took the time to rake my gaze over Gary. At first glance he isn&rsquo;t much for looks. He&rsquo;s pale, but not the sexy   kind  &mdash;his skin has this unhealthy tinge to it, and it&rsquo;s a little blotchy in places. Probably something to do with how skinny he is; and we only just started being able to tolerate each other so I didn&rsquo;t wanna push my luck by asking a question about a touchy subject. Nice thing about wanting to fuck somebody that skinny, though? Everything he wears looks like it&rsquo;s about to fall off. I licked my lips as he sauntered past me, boxers just <em>barely</em> held up by his hips. Man, just a little tug and&hellip; I looked away for a sec&mdash;come on horn dog, <em>focus</em>! &ldquo;So, what&rsquo;chya got in mind for tonight?&rdquo; I already knew what I was hoping for, but we should probably be on the same page. </p>
<p  >Gary hopped up onto the counter next to the sink, tapping his chin like he was thinking. &ldquo;Mm. What could you <em>possibly</em> mean by that, Jimmy-boy?&rdquo; H  e met my   eyes, which I am proud to say were totally <em>not</em> glued to the tank top strap that had fallen off his shoulder. Nope. Then he did the thing where he scans me up and down, then smirks like he just read my mind. That&rsquo;d been creepy at first, but as we&rsquo;ve been getting together more often he&rsquo;s started using his weird psychic powers to know when I need a quick makeout session, or when I wanna spend the first ten minutes of class getting a handjob, or when to skip class altogether so I can shove him against a wall and lick and suck and grind and.. erm&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s a pretty massive turn-on now. &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re getting <em>bored</em>  , hm?  &rdquo; I blinked&mdash;thought I saw a flash of.. somethin&rsquo; in his face when he said that, but it was gone so fast I wasn&rsquo;t even sure I&rsquo;d seen anything. Then he turned all sly and added, &ldquo;Perhaps we could do something a little more&hellip; <em>interesting</em> than just rubbing one out?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Well either way those were some &lsquo;fuck me&rsquo; eyes if I&rsquo;d ever seen &lsquo;em. I grinned, walking up to him and adjusting the strap I&rsquo;d noticed earlier. &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; damn, you know that&rsquo;s really hot when you do that?&rdquo; I leaned forward, running my tongue over his bottom lip before we opened our mouths and made out for a bit. Mm.. we hadn&rsquo;t got to do <em>anything</em> the last couple of days, what with packing up for this trip thing and meeting Pete&rsquo;s family (again). &lsquo;Course normally I can just mess around with somebody else, but since it&rsquo;s winter break, nobody who&rsquo;ll make out with me is really around. So yeah, three days without getting any action it&rsquo;s only natural that my mind might.. wander a bit off the beaten path, right? I moaned softly as he probed my mouth&mdash;plus, Gary&rsquo;s just a damn good kisser. I ran my hands over his arms as I started sucking on his tongue, surprised by how cold he felt. Hadn&rsquo;t he been in a sleeping bag a few minutes ago? </p>
<p  >When we pulled back, panting a little, he asked, &ldquo;Do what, now?&rdquo; I shrugged and scanned the now-familiar territory of his neck. Awesome, some of the more intense hickeys were still there! </p>
<p  >I leaned my forehead against his as I rubbed my thumb over a couple of them and said in my sexy voice, &ldquo;Ya know, that mind reading thing,&rdquo; Another good thing about how he looks; it&rsquo;s <em>real</em> easy to leave marks on his skin. Which he likes. <em>A lot</em>. Usually at school when we run into each other, any &lsquo;interaction&rsquo; turns into a race to get the most licking and sucking in before the prefects try to bust us for skipping class. </p>
<p  >His breathing hitched a little at the contact, but he snorted. &ldquo;Hardly, Jimmy&mdash;you two are the only people whose minds I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> read.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes; the fuck&rsquo;s that supposed to mean? &ldquo;Then how&rsquo;d you know I was thinkin&rsquo; of doing something new?&rdquo; I mean I know I&rsquo;m easy to read, but c&rsquo;mon. </p>
<p  >He shrugged, scooting forward to pull my shirt off. &ldquo;Basic logic&mdash;usually you don&rsquo;t even ask. Since you did, it implies you&rsquo;ve got a goal,&rdquo; Psh, and I&rsquo;d-a just thought of it like &lsquo;so what do you wanna do&rsquo;. All those extra years he&rsquo;d lived at work, maybe. His face lit up suddenly, and he added, &ldquo;Ooh, want me to guess what it is you want to try?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shrugged. &ldquo;  Sure, man,  &rdquo; Gary doesn&rsquo;t get enthusiastic or excited much&mdash;so it was kinda sweet to see such a real expression on his face. He smirked before doing that thoughtful &lsquo;looking up at the celling&rsquo; thing. Would&rsquo;ve made a fine &lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about something seriously&rsquo; face, if he hadn&rsquo;t also been teasing one of my nipples. </p>
<p  >Ya know, it&rsquo;s funny; I had thought I was pretty much an expert on sex. I&rsquo;ve heard it all&mdash;people screaming my name, people screaming somebody <em>else's</em> name, people who wanna dominate, people who wanna be dominated, etc. Still, in all my years of getting laid I&rsquo;d never met anybody as, well, <em>intense</em> as Gary. Like yeah, I&rsquo;ve heard people say stuff like &lsquo;oh I wanna fuck you on the beach so anyone can see&rsquo; (especially from <em>Kirby</em>, of all fucking people), but that was all it&rsquo;d ever been; stuff to say to get your motors going, not something you&rsquo;d actually do. </p>
<p  >But Gary? When he says that it feels like he really <em>means</em> it. Because he can make it happen&mdash;hell, I&rsquo;ve seen how crazy his schemes can get first-hand. I shuddered a little, feeling my stomach clench as I remembered that first week of pure terror. Which, I mean, yeah, it sucked&mdash;but it was basically a nonstop adrenaline rush, too. And shit, that&rsquo;s a relationship with Gary in a nutshell. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if he&rsquo;s tying you to a chair, punching you in the face, or constantly dragging you into a corner to bone; all you know is you&rsquo;re in for one hell of a ride. Gary suddenly snapped his gaze back down, smirking. &ldquo;You want me to go down on you,&rdquo; Well, that was pretty close. </p>
<p  >I rubbed the back of my neck and shrugged. &ldquo;Actually, <em>I</em> wanted to go down on <em>you</em>&hellip;&rdquo; I smiled a little when his face turned a slight pink even though he tried to keep his expression neutral&mdash;heh, he can be pretty cute sometimes. I shrugged, adding, &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;d be <em>against</em> that or anything.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >For a couple seconds all I could hear was the slight buzzing of the light and the wind rattling the window. Eventually though, Gary&rsquo;d done his &lsquo;<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">information successfully processed &rsquo; thing. &ldquo;&hellip;how about I do you first?&rdquo; I grinned, and nodded. Fuck, that sounded awesome! He smirked, saying in a low tone, &ldquo;Whoa, ya eager for somethin&rsquo; or what?&rdquo; He slipped off the counter and moved me back so I was pressed up against the wall. I licked my lips as I watched and <em>felt</em> him pull my pants down and run a finger coyly along the band of my briefs before slipping his hand inside to stroke me. I moaned&mdash;fuck, usually when we &lsquo;rub one out&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s in the dark&mdash;being able to see <em>everything</em> made it all a little extra sexy. I could feel him smirk against my collarbone as I tried to grope anything I could get my hands on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that as a yes, then,&rdquo; Ooooh yeah&hellip; his tongue and teeth on my chest might&rsquo;ve felt weird if it had been just that, but the slow, even stroking made it <em>sooo</em> much nicer. Soon, though (maybe a little too soon) he pulled his head back, licking his lips and sinking to his knees. </p>
<p  >I swallowed&mdash;Goddamn, I hadn&rsquo;t seen Gary on his knees in a <em>while</em>. I&rsquo;d loooved forcing him to kneel back when we were fighting, &lsquo;cuz that shit is <em>hot</em>   as <em>fuck</em>.   I   exhaled as I watched him   pull my briefs off  . I groaned and muttered, &ldquo;Shit baby, you look good on your knees like that&hellip;&rdquo; I&rsquo;d been pretty hard before but now I was a fuckin&rsquo; diamond. </p>
<p  >I only caught the quick flash of surprise on his face &lsquo;cause I was lookin&rsquo; right at him. And he didn&rsquo;t let me think about it anymore by &nbsp;chuckling as he leaned in with an, &ldquo;Aw, <em>Jimmy</em>,&rdquo;   and gave my dick the same &lsquo;scan&rsquo; that he&rsquo;d done earlier.   Then he was leaning in further, so it felt almost like he was <em>cradling</em> me. </p>
<p  >I mumbled to myself, &ldquo;Mm yeaah that looks so hot, man..&rdquo; but my mouth was just going on autopilot by now. </p>
<p  >He finally looked up and smirked. &ldquo;If you wanted me on my knees this badly you could&rsquo;ve just said!&rdquo; And then I was feeling the flat of Gary&rsquo;s tongue all along   my shaft and <em>watching</em> him lap up my dick. </p>
<p  >I was seriously torn between watching and closing my eyes. I mean, if I <em>watched</em>, it&rsquo;d probably be over faster. I took a shuddering breath as he moved from the side to the front, slipping the tip in his mouth and efficiently swirling it with his tongue before pulling back to coat it in saliva. &ldquo;MMmmm oh my God fuuuuck&rdquo; On the other, I really,<em> really</em> wanted to watch. I braced myself against the wall, putting my hands on the back of his head as he actually began sucking me in. &ldquo;Oh maaaan <em>Gary</em>, uhhhhmmm&hellip;&rdquo; Shit, he really wasn&rsquo;t messing around&mdash;I had to bite a knuckle and squeeze my eyes shut as he set a <em>punishing</em> rhythm. Fuck, it was like he was worried somebody&rsquo;d walk in or something! Suddenly, the orgasm I was hurtling toward at a hundred miles an hour was the <em>last</em> thing I wanted. &ldquo;Ughh slow down Jesus,&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t even giving his own dick any attention! If he was turned on blowing me. He probably was, the little perv. I smiled at that thought before he suddenly deep-throated me, and my entire fucking world shrunk to <em>slick clenching pressure </em>holy shit Gary&rsquo;s <em>deep-throating</em> me   no no no I  &rsquo;m gonna come before him <em>noo!!</em>   &ldquo;  MMMMMMM HOLY FUCK   Stopstopstop Gary, stop <em>shiiiiit</em>&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He pulled back right away, coughing for a bit before frowning up at me as I gulped down air. &ldquo;Why? What happened  ?  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shook my head, still reeling a bit. Whoa, that&rsquo;d been intense. &ldquo;Sorry just.. I was about to come&hellip;&rdquo; I blinked. Wait&hellip; when I said it like <em>that</em> it sounded dumb.... </p>
<p  >Gary, still kneeling, was looking at me like I was a fucking idiot. &ldquo;&hellip;You were about to <em>come</em>?&rdquo; He stood up, crossing his arms and, no joke, squinting at me like I was a stupid kid or something. I scratched the back of my head, shrugging. &ldquo;You mean you were about to do the thing that is <em>the point</em> of all sexual interaction? <em>That</em> was why you told me to stop?&rdquo; He laughed dryly, rolling his eyes and wiping the excess saliva off his mouth. &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s <em>beyond</em> stupid, even for <em>you</em>.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I glared at him; man, it&rsquo;s not like getting off is the <em>only</em> reason people have sex, sheesh! Whatever: I just picked Gary up by his waist and set him back on the counter. Dang, he really<em> is</em> skinny. &ldquo;Sorry, but.. I wanna come <em>with</em> you,&rdquo; I snickered as his face darkened a little and his eyes widened; damn, love how he only looks like that when <em>I</em> say that kina stuff. &ldquo;Ya know, you&rsquo;re pretty cute when you blush,&rdquo; He scowled at that and was probably gonna reply, but I&rsquo;d already easily tugged his boxers off (<em>knew</em> it!) and started stroking him. As something of an expert on a wide variety of dick, I really gotta admire Gary&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s a respectable length, soft and not&mdash;he&rsquo;s got, like, an inch over me&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve been getting tail long enough not to feel &lsquo;inadequate&rsquo; about that or anything. A little lacking in girth, but that&rsquo;s not much of a problem for me&mdash;it&rsquo;s not like I have the anatomy to appreciate a thick one, after all. But what I really love about it is how the  <em> color </em>  changes. When he&rsquo;s soft, it&rsquo;s all pale, like the rest of his body. But when he gets hard it actually turns this dark red  ;   like a mood ring for horniness! </p>
<p  >&nbsp;Gary&rsquo;s breath had got all shaky as I ran my hand over him; he was even twitching a little. I grinned, leaning down and.. Gary shoved me away. &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; I blinked in surprise until he pulled a hand outta his PJ bottoms with&hellip; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;You wanna use condoms?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He nodded, face still a little flushed. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shook my head and grabbed the package. &ldquo;Nah, man! Why didn&rsquo;t you mention it earlier, though?&rdquo; I gestured to my own slobber-covered dick. &ldquo;You coulda used one, too.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Pulling the rubber out&nbsp; he shrugged. &ldquo;Must have slipped my mind.&rdquo; But the way he said it made me suspiscious. He said it in that tone where he answers a question that clearly has a right answer, but where he&rsquo;s lying out his butt. By now I&rsquo;d been looking at him funny so long he frowned. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Fuck I didn&rsquo;t wanna get into it though. I just wanted his dick in my mouth, is that so fuckin wrong? &ldquo;Nothin,&rdquo; I smirked as I thumbed his dick with my left. &ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re all ready,&rdquo; He shrugged, so I tried to up the anie. Pinching so there wasn&rsquo;t any air in the business end, I did something like what he&rsquo;d done to my dick that one time he stuck his tongue in my butt&mdash;trailing my nose down the underside of his cock as I rolled it down. Gotta say I thought it was pretty fuckin hot. But beyond a little shiver, I didn&rsquo;t get much. His face kinda screamed &ldquo;the fuck&rsquo;re ya waiting for moron?&rdquo; I leaned back. &ldquo;Condoms not your thing or what?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He looked confused I was even asking. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine they&rsquo;re anybody&rsquo;s &lsquo;thing&rsquo;. They&rsquo;re a necessity.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >With Gary&rsquo;s cock fully locked-and-loaded, I could really go to town now. &ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; I leaned in and started licking him like a popsicle. We hadn&rsquo;t done oral yet, and hot <em>damn</em> I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. He licked his lips, squeezing his eyes shut and turning his head away before I started slathering my tongue over the head. I smirked when his eyes popped open and his jaw started working beautifully; time to take it up a notch. </p>
<p  >But as I started pulling his boxers further out of the way, he said in a weirdly calm voice, &ldquo;B-by the way, what does <em>fuckyes</em> coming at the same time <em>rightthere</em> change, exactly?&rdquo; despite gasping every couple of seconds. </p>
<p  >I blinked, stopping mid-lick. &hellip;what the hell? I pulled back a little to respond. &ldquo;Dude, do you want me to suck your dick, or answer your stupid question?&rdquo; That made him scowl, but I just rolled my eyes and went back to feeling all the bumps and veins on his dick through the latex. I started playing with his balls a little too&mdash;it always surprises me how quiet he is, since he&rsquo;d seemed so loud before. Probably my imagination that had made me think he was really loud back then. </p>
<p  >I was getting pretty fucking excited, so I kinda accidentally started using my teeth a little too much. In my defense I wasn&rsquo;t thinking&mdash;but it was hot as hell; I could feel it as my teeth passed from his shaft to the head. &ldquo;holyFUCKingshit~&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I pulled back as soon as I heard that. &ldquo;Shit man, sorry&mdash;&rdquo; but Gary actually put his hand on the back of my head and yanked me back toward his crotch. I laughed a little and rubbed just the tip of my teeth over his dick&mdash;with eye-contact. &lsquo;S what turns an okay bj <em>amazing</em>. &ldquo;You really are a freak, huh babe?&rdquo; His face turned red as shit, but still nodded and trembled when I sucked the whole thing into my mouth, using my tongue to press his dick against my teeth. I reached down and started stroking myself&mdash;shit, I could still feel his saliva covering my cock. But then he stubbornly continued our &lsquo;conversation&rsquo;, even though his sentences started falling apart as I set a rhythm for myself. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t caaaaall it a stupid questioNNnnn&hellip; and I&rsquo;m sure you can fffff<em>fuck</em> find a way to do booOOooth <em>mmmyes</em>&rdquo; What the actual fuck? I looked up, and he had his poker face on big-time, even though the pink flush kinda gave him away. </p>
<p  >I smirked; that was a challenge if I&rsquo;d ever heard it. Gary wanted to talk? That was fine. I sucked so a pretty significant amount of dick was in my mouth before I said, &ldquo;Mmm, I&rsquo;mmm rrrreally&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I wasn&rsquo;t able to say anything else &lsquo;cause he bucked crazy hard and panted at the vibrations I&rsquo;d caused. &ldquo; <em> SHI </em> &mdash;mmmmmmm <sub>keep it.. <em>down</em> we&rsquo;</sub> <sub> re </sub><sub> &hellip; </sub><sub>  under </sub><sub> &hellip; </sub><sub>  Pete </sub><sub> &rsquo;s room! </sub> &rdquo; But he was practically <em>vibrating</em> now he was so tense, and OHman it was fucking hot. I sped up the pumping for myself, bobbing my head up and down faster too. Shit&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got a pretty bad gag reflex, so I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take him in as deep as he&rsquo;d done with me.... Then I got an idea! </p>
<p  >I pulled back without telling him, and when he looked down to bitch at me I locked eyes with him, smirking as I leaned forward and&mdash;keeping eye-contact&mdash;traced one of the veins on the underside of his dick with the tip of my tongue. I grinned when his face turned baldly shocked&mdash;knew that&rsquo;d do it. Then Gary curled into himself as he orgasmed and I just sat back to enjoy the show. Damn, he comes beautifully. He&rsquo;s usually so closed off, never showing emotions he doesn&rsquo;t want to&mdash;now, though, all that shit got thrown out the window. His knuckles turned white on the countertop and when Gary moans, he fuckin&rsquo; <em>moans</em>; I could tell he was trying to be quiet, but the sound still echoed nicely. For a second it was like I could feel it reverberate through my own body as it flooded with heat. I shuddered as I came too, pressing my head into the crook of his neck. </p>
<p  >I took a moment to breathe. Then, I laughed a little and muttered, &ldquo;Damn baby, that&rsquo;ll make good fap material for <em>months</em>  !  &rdquo;   After a while of slowly moving my tongue around in Gary&rsquo;s mouth, though, I got worried when he didn&rsquo;t respond to the kiss. The heck? Moving back to look him over, I tried to ignore the d&eacute;j&agrave; vu from that first time we&rsquo;d kissed. It was like he wasn&rsquo;t seeing anything; he was just <em>staring</em>. &ldquo;Uh&hellip; dude, you okay?&rdquo; That made him snap out of it and lock his gaze on me. Then, he started laughing. Not a &lsquo;ha I just had sex and it was great&rsquo; kind of laugh&mdash;definitely a creepy &lsquo;I&rsquo;m having a mental breakdown&rsquo; laugh.   For a second, I froze and just stared at him as he started shaking. Jesus Christ, what the actual fuck!? Eventually my social instincts kicked in and I rubbed my hands up and down his arms and baby-talk &lt;/&gt; cooed,   &ldquo;Hey, hey, whoa! Come on, you&rsquo;re alright&hellip;&rdquo; I pulled him into a hug, moving my hand in a circle on his back and leaning my head against him. The laughing   finally died down   after   that  , but I was still worried. What the <em>hell</em> had that been about? Gary pulled away from the hug, skootching so his back was pressed flat against the mirror. I waited for a second, expecting <em>some</em> kind of explanation but he just closed his eyes and kept his back all straight. He didn&rsquo;t seem hurt or anything.. &ldquo;Did.. did I do something wrong?...&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Gary chuckled at that, shaking his head. &ldquo;  Oh no, no, no, moron  &hellip; on the contrary, you could say I <em>loved</em>   it  , hehe!  &rdquo; He kept laughing softly to himself as he pressed a hand into his forehead. </p>
<p  >The fuck was I supposed to take from <em>that</em>?   &ldquo;Um, cool. That&rsquo;s.. good?&rdquo; Man, I always feel out of my depth when doing anything that&rsquo;s not fighting or fucking Gary. Too bad I can&rsquo;t ask Pete about this stuff&hellip; Either way, I smirked, adding, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not too bad with your mouth yourself.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Gary dropped the hand and smiled, his eyes still closed. &ldquo;Mmm..&rdquo; Then he dipped his head a bit and opened his eyes, looking at me coyly through his eyelashes. &ldquo;Aw, but I hardly got to do anything to <em>you</em>....&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I groaned; shit, he looked soooo hot! I reached down to pull up my briefs. &ldquo;Come on man, don&rsquo;t <em>do</em> that! We&rsquo;ve got stuff to do tomorrow  ,  &rdquo; I picked up my pants and shirt while I was kneeling, only <em>now</em> noticing that he still had his shirt on. Damn. Well,   always   next time. </p>
<p  >Gary hooked his arms around my neck after I straightened up, but didn&rsquo;t pull me closer to kiss me like usual, just scanned my face. He asked kinda distractedly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do what?&rdquo; It was a little weird, how he was looking at me. Gary doesn&rsquo;t normally look at me so intense. Like.. like I was the first person he&rsquo;d ever seen or something, you know? But it&rsquo;s not like I can read him anyway. </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes as I started pulling my pants back up. &ldquo;You know, the thing where you turn into a little sex kitten after we fuck&mdash;that means <em>I</em> gotta be the responsible one.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I half-smiled as he snorted, looking surprised. &ldquo;&lsquo;Sex kitten&rsquo;  ?  &rdquo; He slid off the counter, following me out the door as I pulled my shirt on and snapped the light off. </p>
<p  >With the light off I groped blindly until I felt his hand. Then I started tugging us back toward the stairs, whispering, &ldquo;Yeah, man. And as hot as it is, I gotta sleep, ya know?&rdquo; I was seriously pushing it by getting up in the middle of the night. He hm&rsquo;d distractedly, squeezing my hand. As we walked up the stairs I rubbed his wrist with my thumb and squeezed back. I snorted, adding in another whisper, &ldquo;Unlike <em>some</em> freaks who can sleep, like, two hours a night and be fine,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t see his face anymore, but I heard him snort. When we reached the top floor, he moved to head to the guest room, but I tightened my grip and dragged him toward Pete&rsquo;s room instead. &ldquo;&lsquo;C&rsquo;mon, Pete&rsquo;ll be less weirded out by you showing up than   D  i  ck   would by me,&rdquo; As soon as Gary closed the door behind us, I started wrapping my arm around his waist and pulling him down into the nest of blankets the Kowalskis had given me to sleep on. Man, I dunno why but I love how easily I can wrap my whole arm around Gary&rsquo;s body. </p>
<p  >His shoulder blades dug into my chest as I pressed us closer together, but it was worth it when I felt him shiver&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t usually say anything about me holding him, but I can tell he loves it. I could feel the warmth start to get into my brain as we spooned and pretty soon I was almost asleep again. I was right on the brink of falling back asleep when I felt Gary shift against me and whisper something, &ldquo;<sub>&hellip;love you&hellip;</sub>&rdquo; that I didn&rsquo;t catch. </p>
<p  >I grunted, mentally scraping enough sleep off to mumble, &ldquo;mm wad&rsquo;ya say babe?&rdquo; while I nuzzled his ear a bit with my nose, but I seriously didn&rsquo;t have enough energy to do anything else. </p>
<p  >He tensed up a bit, and his voice was way clearer than mine when he said, &ldquo;Nothing, moron. Just talking in my sleep.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I just slurred an, &ldquo;Mmkay,&rdquo; and nuzzled my head into the crook of his neck one last time before clocking out to Gary&rsquo;s heartbeat. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~ Chapter 26: The K-wall Klan (they generally say &ldquo;clan&rdquo;, though)~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I was awake, but I hadn&rsquo;t bothered to move yet, just soaking in Jimmy&rsquo;s body heat. Well, except for my left arm&mdash;that was pinned under him, so it&rsquo;d gone numb in the night. I opened my eyes, bracing my other arm on Jimmy&rsquo;s shoulder and carefully rolling him off. He muttered something unintelligible, but didn&rsquo;t wake up. </p>
<p  >I had been planning on sitting up after that, but instead I rolled onto my other side and pressed my back flush to his, leaving me to face the rest of Petey&rsquo;s room while I let the numbness fade to be replaced with the pins-and-needles feeling. It was still dark, but I could hear some quiet movement in the house. Either Femme Boy&rsquo;s parents, or that relative they had sleeping in the guest room. I sighed as the last dregs of the old untethered feeling drained away. Guess that was my cue to get up. I sat up, still leaning against Jimmy&rsquo;s back as I thought about last night. </p>
<p ><em> The cold countertop had faded to mere background noise as Jimmy's mouth assaulted my crotch with sensations. But just as I'd been close, he had stopped, pulling away. The memory of making Petey blow me suddenly reared its ugly head, filling me with a cold, sinking dread.  </em> Oh God   I   knew it I knew Jimmy  &rsquo;d   just been stringing m  e   along it   w  a  s   all an act and now he'  ll   do the only logical thing and stop messing around with a literal fucking rapist<em>&mdash;but as I'd forced myself to look my long-deserved rejection square in the face, Jimmy'd smiled at me. What? Then he had gently, </em>tenderly<em>, traced one of the veins on the underside of my dick, never breaking eye-contact. The relief at not being left alone </em>  (yet)<em>, the intoxicating intimacy of such a gesture, and the spasms of physical pleasure that were still crashing over me were just too much, and</em> <em>  the normally never-ending analysis of the situation stopped, replaced by a jumbled collection of memories that all related to Jimmy in some way that I couldn&rsquo;t relate on their own, but together they all added up to an intense feeling that could only be described as  </em><strong> love </strong><em> . </em></p>
<p  >I sighed, running a hand down my face as I returned to the present. Ha, if I had told myself I&rsquo;d be thinking <em>that</em> about the moron a decade ago, I&rsquo;d have checked myself in at Happy Volts. What was most surprising was how I wasn&rsquo;t even really that surprised; it felt like that feeling had been building up for both of them since the Road Trip. Sure, I&rsquo;d.. felt strongly for Petey even before the Road Trip, but this feeling is so different from the obsession I&rsquo;d had with Femme Boy before&hellip; this is messy and confusing and not always pleasant. I have so much guilt about Petey and lingering jealousy for Jimmy that sometimes there's a part of me that wants to strangle them both; but at the same time, I can't bear the thought of either of them suffering like that. If somebody had wanted to do what I sometimes contemplate when the insomnia won't let me sleep because I was wrong about where Jimmy would be   that day   and I didn't want to know if he'd gone and found somebody else to have sex with, I would have freaked the fuck out. Hell, forget contemplation&mdash;I get pissed just remembering what I used to do with mind-numbing regularity, swinging from orchestrating carefully-crafted accidents that shielded me from any blame to just stabbing him thirty-seven times in the chest. Still, though; this.. love, I guess, isn&rsquo;t all bad. It&rsquo;s so subtle, and, well, it&rsquo;s <em>real</em>. </p>
<p  >My train of thought was interrupted when I heard a rustle from the bed on the other side of the room. I could just make out Petey&rsquo;s form throwing his covers off and getting out of bed. I said quietly, &ldquo;Hey, Pete..&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He turned my way quickly, startled a bit by my greeting. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Gary? Heh, good morning,&rdquo; He looked around for a bit, head seeming to land on his desk before moving toward it. As he did so, he whispered cheekily, &ldquo;No prizes for guessing what you and Jimmy did last night, huh?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I debated mentally for a few seconds before speaking. &ldquo;Pete.. you.. you know I&rsquo;m sorry, right?&rdquo; That halted his progress. </p>
<p  >The room was mostly silent, save the slight sounds of cooking that were drifting up from the floor below. Even the wind had died down. He turned, walking over to a small table next to where Jimmy and I had set up camp. He fumbled for a bit before snapping on a small lamp that was there. When the light was on, he said, &ldquo;There we go!&rdquo; And looked at me, smiling that slightly-cocky Femme Boy smile that I&rsquo;d come to&hellip; love. He then sat down on the rug across from me, running a hand through his hair as he sighed. &ldquo;  Well, I  &rsquo;d always <em>assumed</em> you were sorry. I mean, it seemed like you were. Are,&rdquo; He looked at me thoughtfully for a moment before smiling warmly, adding, &ldquo;It means a lot that you actually <em>said</em> it, though.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I laughed dryly, closing my eyes, saying, &ldquo;Sometimes&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if I <em>am</em> sorry,&rdquo; I could hear somebody making their way up the stairs from here in the silence. </p>
<p  >After a moment, whoever it was had made it to the top floor. Eventually, Petey said, &ldquo;Because if you hadn&rsquo;t, Jimmy and I wouldn&rsquo;t be here, right?&rdquo; That made me laugh&mdash;only Petey would be able to get me so easily. </p>
<p  >I gazed at him in wonder. &ldquo;What did I ever do to deserve you?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t get the chance to reply because at that moment, the door to the room opened and somebody snapped the light on. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Come on, Peter, it&rsquo;s time to&hellip;&rdquo; but Femme Mom started when she saw her son out of bed. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re up early!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Femme Boy laughed awkwardly, looking at me apologetically before getting back up to move over to his closet. &ldquo;Yeah, I was just about to come downstairs. Is breakfast ready yet?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >She nodded, then noticed that I was awake. &ldquo;Ah, good morning Gary. Still  &hellip;&rdquo; she yawned before continuing &ldquo;&hellip;sorry, still   an early riser, then?&rdquo; I frowned, trying to reason out her reaction&mdash;that&rsquo;s <em>right</em> the last time she&rsquo;d met me it had been when Petey and I were kids. I nodded to myself; that explained it. She must&rsquo;ve taken it as my response because she smiled, saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;  s nice  &mdash;always wished I could be more of an early bird, myself,&rdquo; She yawned   again  , taking a sip of the steaming mug of coffee she had clutched in one hand. </p>
<p  >I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to say to that. Luckily, Petey came to my rescue. &ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;d better get moving,&rdquo; He held out a hand to pull me up off the floor, adding &ldquo;Long day ahead of us, especially with one extra person,&rdquo; As he helped me get up, he handed me a sweatshirt, too&mdash;good point, it <em>was</em> twenty below outside, after all. And it wasn&rsquo;t like I had the human space heater to keep me focused on.. other things this time. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping it&rsquo;s not <em>too</em> long&hellip;&rdquo; Femme Mom gave Petey a long-suffering look. &ldquo;Your father has <em>assured</em> me he&rsquo;s got all the directions he needs this time,&rdquo; The two of them shared a laugh as they walked into the hallway, me trailing behind as I pulled the sweatshirt on over my head. I was struck again by how naturally Petey acts around, well, everybody. He hasn&rsquo;t been around as long as I have but he seems to inspire different interactions in people each time somehow. After pulling my head through the hoodie, my libido suddenly realized <em>holy crap I'm wearing Petey's clothes</em> and sent blood to my groin. I suppressed an annoyed groan&mdash;<em>perfect</em>. Petey and Femme Mom were discussing&hellip; something? I tuned in while we made our way down the stairs, figuring it might distract me. &ldquo;&hellip;try and make sure they feel welcome, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey nodded as we hit the foot of the landing. &ldquo;&lsquo;Course, Mom.&rdquo; I could hear his smile in his next line, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be able to find <em>some</em>body in our family for Gary to like&mdash;and I <em>know</em> Jimmy will.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >She replied &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you will, pumpkin,&rdquo; But as he sat down at the breakfast bar, she put her hand on his shoulder. She looked a little worried. &ldquo;Just&hellip; remember, sometimes things don&rsquo;t always work as well as we hope&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I honestly couldn&rsquo;t tell if Femme Boy had experienced this scenario yet or not as I took the seat next to him. He sighed, crossing his arms in his oversized sweatshirt and leaning them on the counter. &ldquo;I know, Mom&mdash;I&rsquo;m keeping an open mind, I promise.&rdquo; Then, he looked around. &ldquo;So, where&rsquo;  s Dad?  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >In answer to his question, a crash followed by a yell of &ldquo;A   LITTLE HELP, PLEASE?  &rdquo; sounded from behind us, what I knew to be the basement. </p>
<p  >Petey sighed, slipping off his seat just as she put a plate of waffles in front of him. &ldquo;Be right back,&rdquo; And before turning away, he threw me a look my way that said <em>behave</em>. Heh. Fair enough. </p>
<p  >I ate some food to pass the time. It was good, that much I could tell. The soft &lsquo;clink&rsquo; of two glasses of liquid being set down interrupted my boredom. &ldquo;So, Gary,&rdquo; I looked up, and she had her arms crossed and was leaning on the other side of the counter in much the same way Petey had just been sitting. &ldquo;How has the Academy been treating you?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I frowned. Usually, I&rsquo;m happy to let people string me along in conversation since it gives me more opportunity to manipulate the situation. But I didn&rsquo;t really want to go through the whole rigmarole with Petey&rsquo;s family. I stabbed a bite of waffle as I said &ldquo;As well as can be expected,&rdquo; I made eye-contact for the next line. &ldquo;Do you want to make more small-talk or would you rather ask me an <em>important</em>   question?  &rdquo; I took the bite of waffle after that, chewing as she did the signature Kowalski &lsquo;blink twice to process statement&rsquo; procedure. </p>
<p  >Then she laughed, shaking her head. &ldquo;I see you haven&rsquo;t changed a bit!&rdquo; I raised an eyebrow at that, but she sighed, frowning thoughtfully as she said &ldquo;I suppose I just want to know how Peter&rsquo;s doing&hellip;&rdquo; I stiffened. Shit. &ldquo;He seems.. different, somehow.&rdquo; She met my gaze, and I noticed she had the same worried-but-not-showing-it smile her son did. &ldquo;Is he doing all right? <em>Really</em> all right?&rdquo; She held eye-contact for a while, before I automatically turned to look behind me at the sound of Petey and Femme Dad coming back up the stairs from the basement. </p>
<p  >I took a deep breath and, turning and leaning back forward, I   beckoned   t  o   her as if I were about to whisper a secret. She did so too, but I could tell she was just humoring me. &ldquo;Do you really want to know?&rdquo; She looked puzzled by my ominous tone, but nodded. Then, I grinned. &ldquo;He is the kindest, smartest, bravest person I have <em>ever</em> met,&rdquo; I leaned back as she processed that, picking my fork back up and stuffing more food in my mouth before adding &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got <em>nothing</em> to worry about with that kid, trust me.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >A warm smile grew on her lips right before I heard Femme Boy himself talking behind me. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Dad, just trust me, Jimmy&rsquo;s <em>really</em> strong. If you lift it together, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be able to move it,&rdquo; He hopped back up on his stool, tucking in almost immediately. </p>
<p  >Femme Dad was scratching his head uncertainly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right, but I don&rsquo;t know how comfortable I am having a fifteen-year-old lift something so heavy&hellip;&rdquo; He stopped when he noticed me looking at him. &ldquo;Ah, good morning Gary! And how did you sleep?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I grunted in the affirmative automatically before turning to Petey. &ldquo;Hey, Femme Boy, what&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;re trying to lift?&rdquo; He glanced up at me, still chewing as he lifted one eyebrow questioningly. I swatted the giddy butterflies away and forced myself to only make eye-contact for a few seconds before pointing my fork at the celling. &ldquo;If you want, I can get the moron up,&rdquo; Hopefully it&rsquo;d get easier. </p>
<p  >He frowned, swallowing before saying worriedly &ldquo;You sure? Jimmy doesn&rsquo;t really like people waking him up&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I smirked as I grabbed the glass of juice his mom had just set down. &ldquo;Oh, I have my ways,&rdquo; Pete made an &lsquo;ew&rsquo; face, but he still laughed. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Peter, may I speak to you in the living room for a moment?&rdquo; Petey&rsquo;s eyes widened at that, and he looked at Femme Dad, who was crossing his arms and sporting a pissed-off expression. And going by Petey's expression, that was not a normal occurrence. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Uh.. sure, Dad.&rdquo; He turned to his food sadly, adding to me &ldquo;Yeah, you should probably get Jimmy up&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got a <em>ton</em> to do.&rdquo; And he slipped off his stool again. I shrugged, following suit, giving him a salute as I headed back upstairs. </p>
<p  >On my way, I passed the other person staying in the house&mdash;I think he was Pete&rsquo;s uncle. He nodded to me, and I nodded back automatically. I had never been invited to stay at Pete&rsquo;s for Christmas before (not for lack of trying, mind), but I&rsquo;d never gotten so desperate that I was willing to break in uninvited   (I&rsquo;d wait until they were gone to do that)  , so these events were new to me. I&rsquo;d heard Petey talk about this guy, but I&rsquo;d never met him myself. Well, I&rsquo;d certainly have enough time to get to know him while we were packing up for this little road trip. Femme Boy&rsquo;s family always went to some family reunion&hellip; thing in California for Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s. I shook my head as I opened the door to Pete&rsquo;s room&mdash;it&rsquo;d always seemed a strange concept to me. My family takes pains to <em>avoid</em> each other, a fact that I had learned to take for granted over the course of the loops. Nowadays it practically feels like I don&rsquo;t have a family. </p>
<p  >Well, had felt.   I examined Jimmy&rsquo;s sleeping form as I made my way across the room&mdash;he was still turned on his side. I smirked; now, now; that would <em>never</em> do. Kneeling next to him, I rolled him onto his back and, pushing his shirt up, dipped my head to blow a raspberry on his stomach. &ldquo;PPBFT!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >The reaction was instantaneous, and as hilarious as I&rsquo;d hoped. &ldquo;  GAH HOLY SHIT!  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >I patted him on the cheek, grinning at his startled expression. &ldquo;Rise and shine, big guy! Apparently there&rsquo;s a ton to do around here&mdash;emphasis on <em>ton</em>, since we'll need your skills as a beast of burden.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He groaned, letting his head fall back into the mess of blankets. &ldquo;Maaaan, couldn&rsquo;t you have woken me up like you did a couple weeks ago?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Petey would appreciate the sperm on his floor,&rdquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to just drag him downstairs, he&rsquo;s too heavy for that. Luckily, I had other methods. &ldquo;Of course if you <em>do</em> get up now, maybe later I can finish up that blowjob you interrupted?&rdquo; I smirked when he immediately perked up at that. Typical moron&mdash;so easy to manipulate. Thank God, otherwise I never would've been able to keep this up for a month. </p>
<p  >He considered. &ldquo;&hellip;like, right <em>now</em>, now? Or&hellip;&rdquo; here he grabbed the scruff of my sweatshirt and yanked me down so I was lying across him. My heart sped up a bit at the reminder that Femme Boy had <em>given</em> me his clothes to wear as Jimmy dipped his voice down a couple octaves. &ldquo;&hellip;&lsquo;later&rsquo; now?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Mm. Tempting. I swallowed thickly&mdash;what harm could a couple minutes do? But, I flicked my eyes toward the door as somebody, Petey from the sound, came down the hall. &ldquo;Right now, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; before I pushing myself off his chest just as Femme Boy walked into the room. That was close. </p>
<p  >Turning his way as Jimmy sat up, I noticed that Petey&rsquo;s expression was oddly pained. He was supporting his head with his hand over one eye, and his other arm was tucked close to his body. &ldquo;Okay, so I just went to the bathroom downstairs.&rdquo; I cocked my head to the side, confused about why this was news. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Um. Congrats, Petey?&rdquo; To my surprise, I saw Jimmy stiffen and look at him in horror. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;  Oh! OH shit  &hellip;&rdquo; He slapped his hand to his forehead. &ldquo;Oh my God.. dude, I am  <em> soooo </em>  sorry!  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey looked a little relieved, crossing his arms as he sat down on his bed with a huff. &ldquo;I hope so&hellip; just go clean it up, okay? And don&rsquo;t do it again.&rdquo; He shook his head, adding &ldquo;I mean <em>seriously</em> guys? Just&hellip; two seconds was all it would&rsquo;ve taken.  <em> Two seconds. </em> &rdquo; </p>
<p  >I felt a light-bulb go off in my head, and I burst out laughing. Man, we totally forgot to clean up last night! &ldquo;Hahahaha, well!&rdquo; I slapped Jimmy on the back as I stood up. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s what happens when we make <em>you</em> the responsible one!&rdquo; I continued giggling as I made my way to the door. I had been rather preoccupied last night, after all. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Gary, hold up. I have something else to say to you,&rdquo; I turned toward Petey and he had his Serious Talk Time face on. Ho boy. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;What? What did <em>I</em>   do?  &rdquo; As he left to go downstairs, Jimmy threw a couple of finger-guns my way and grinned cheekily before shutting the door. Traitor. </p>
<p  >Pete shook his head. &ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s not&hellip; that bad. Dad just pulled me aside and asked me if you were going to, and I quote, &lsquo;be as rude to our family as you were to him&rsquo;.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I blinked, furrowing my brow. &ldquo;What? Rude?&rdquo; I thought to the.. shit, <em>five seconds</em> of interaction I&rsquo;d just had with Femme Dad. &ldquo;What the hell? I answered his question, what more does he want?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey sighed.   &ldquo;Look, I didn&rsquo;t notice it at the time but you <em>were</em> kind of rude to him,&rdquo; My jaw dropped at that&mdash;what? </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Oh my G&ndash;who even <em>cares</em>  ?  &rdquo; I waved my hand dismissively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;ll remember, right?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey steepled his fingers as he gave me an appraising look. &ldquo;Look. I know that you don&rsquo;t think his opinion matters, and I get <em>why</em> you think that. But you can&rsquo;t just&hellip; treat people like they don&rsquo;t matter, okay?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I tilted my head, looking at him as if he&rsquo;d grown a second head. &ldquo;But.. they <em>don&rsquo;t</em>  !  &rdquo; </p>
<p  >Pete gave me an even look. &ldquo;Oh, so Jimmy and I don&rsquo;t matter, huh?&rdquo;   WHAT!? </p>
<p  >I was waving my arms almost at random now. &ldquo;Of course <em>YOU</em> do, and Jimmy! But why should I give a shit about anybody else?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re people too?&rdquo; I just stared at him. What the hell was he even talking about? Petey let out a massive sigh, and he closed his eyes, clearly thinking. He said slowly &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a very.. <em>healthy</em> attitude to have, Gary. But I know I can&rsquo;t really change your mind about it.&rdquo; Here he opened his eyes, and gave me a very level look. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re rude, or a prick, you&rsquo;re not going to get invited back. Understand?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snorted. &ldquo;  Oooh, I  &rsquo;m  <em> soooo </em>  scared,&rdquo; Rolling my eyes I added &ldquo;Come on, it&rsquo;s not like Femme Mom and Dad&rsquo;ll even remember next time.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey blinked. &ldquo;Um. First of all, my parents have names? Alison and Finch? Second of all&hellip;&rdquo; here he smirked. Uh oh. &ldquo;<em>They&rsquo;re</em> not the ones who invited you&mdash;<em>I</em> did,&rdquo; &hellip;oh. &ldquo;And <em>I&rsquo;m</em> not going to forget if you&rsquo;re an asshole, okay?&rdquo; Here he paused. I gulped. Shit&hellip; I really <em>was</em> going to have to act different. He sighed, looking at me sidelong as he got up and headed for the door. &ldquo;Come on Gary; don&rsquo;t look so worried&mdash;I&rsquo;ll probably be more lenient than my parents would, anyway. I <em>do</em> know you,&rdquo; That let me relax a little as I followed Femme Boy back into the hallway. &ldquo;As long as I can see you&rsquo;re <em>genuinely</em> trying, of course you can come back next year! Er, loop.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Phew&hellip; thank God.   I grinned, adding   &ldquo;All right, then, Petey. I&rsquo;ll <em>try</em> and treat the people at this reunion like they&rsquo;re not a bunch of morons. Happy now?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I saw him roll his eyes as he turned to descend the stairs. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s the best I&rsquo;m going to get.&rdquo; He brightened, looking back as we reached the landing. &ldquo;But hey, are you excited? I can&rsquo;t wait for you to, you know, <em>actually</em> meet my family!&rdquo; I nodded as we entered the den, sighing. Had it seriously only been two   loop  s since he&rsquo;d forgiven me? Hard to believe. </p>
<p  >~~~  </p>
<p  >The next hour or so was spent getting dressed, trying to find things we <em>absolutely had to bring</em> that had somehow vanished, trying to play Tetris with everyone&rsquo;s luggage, and just everybody generally getting in everybody&rsquo;s way. But I smiled as the last of Bullworth disappeared over the horizon. I&rsquo;d been leaving town rather a lot recently, but there&rsquo;s always a small amount of giddiness to plunging headlong into the unknown. I was kneeling on the seat with my arms crossed over the back. I laid my head on my arms, watching the only-slightly-less-familiar landscape of the area around Bullworth zip by as I tried to watch Jimmy out of the corner of my eye without him noticing. He&rsquo;d crossed his arms and his head was leaning back into the seat. He really looked tired. As I watched his chest rise and fall, I felt that <em>love</em> bubble up again. </p>
<p  >I turned around and sat down, carefully leaning against him. I must&rsquo;ve not been careful enough, because he stirred a little, blinking his eyes open and groaning. He mumbled &ldquo;Mmm, we there yet?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I laughed softly as he closed his eyes again, leaning against me. &ldquo;Twelve minutes isn&rsquo;t very long, so no, moron,&rdquo; He just &lsquo;hm&rsquo;d and made himself comfortable. The butterflies in my stomach began sucking on my innerds with their straw-lije mouthpieces as he wrapped an arm around my waist and began trailing his mouth up and down my neck. &ldquo;That bj better be amazing, psycho. Jesus, I feellike I could sleep for a fuckin week..&rdquo; </p>
<p  >&ldquo;It will be, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; I sounded much more confident than I felt, but for now I just let myself indulge in the simulated intimacy Jimmy was so happy to provide as he nuzzled his face into the crook of my shoulder and fell asleep. </p>
<p > &lt;&lt;Hear that? It&rsquo;s the sound of tragic violin music&gt;&gt; ~~~~~~  Chapter 27: Gary Loves to Make His Own Problems  ~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I really shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised by Jimmy slipping away with one of Pete&rsquo;s cousins on New Years&rsquo; eve. He&rsquo;d been making goo-goo eyes her way throughout the last week-and-a-half, and she&rsquo;d been doing that &lsquo;I know you want me but I want you to work for it&rsquo; thing that people who use sex as a way to validate themselves do. And yeah, I <em>had</em> noticed and it disgusted me on multiple levels; from being physically repulsed to think that when Jimmy touched me it was like I was touching her by proxy to mentally scrambling to gather information on her. The people and kids in Bullworth are different&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been with them all plenty of times myself, and they&rsquo;re so predictable by now that it just&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t worry me when Jimmy&rsquo;s with one of them. It <em>bothers</em> me, of course. But it never worries me&mdash;he always comes back because I&rsquo;m the only one who can give him something different. This new girl, though&mdash;everything about her is new. Even I can tell that she&rsquo;s smoking hot, with more curves than any of the girls back home; if I didn&rsquo;t know better I would have said she was out of Jimmy&rsquo;s league. </p>
<p  >So I&rsquo;d spent the week focusing on everything and anything else. Lucky for me there was <em>plenty</em> to freak out about; I had known that this trip was going to be a new experience, but holy <strong>fuck</strong> is it ever exhausting to constantly interact with idiots in a way that doesn&rsquo;t imply you think they&rsquo;re stupid. Jimmy&rsquo;s already none too bright himself, but how Femme Boy manages it is beyond me. </p>
<p  >Only nine months had passed since Petey forgave me, and I was only now really starting to wrap my head around just how differently things were now&lt;&lt;moment&gt;. For God&rsquo;s sake, everything changes so <em>fast</em> with the two of them remembering! A truckload of decades of conniving and scheming and planning and plotting couldn&rsquo;t get Femme Boy to side with me in taking over the school, but a few years is all he needs to forgive me for fucking kidnapping and raping him? Four months ago Jimmy had been seriously threatening me with bodily harm nearly daily, but just &lt;&lt;mmmm tiiime&gt;<em>two months ago</em> he began regularly jerking me off in lieu of said bodily harm? It makes me feel almost dizzy when I think about; but even worse, it had got me thinking about what might happen if the loops ever ended. thrust into situations with no prior knowledge to go on, no ability to try again if things don&rsquo;t work out, never being able to know if what I was doing was truly the best choice. Christ, trying to ensure that Petey and Jimmy think of me the way I want is hard enough without being able to try new approaches, plus the fact that their opinions are really the only ones I care about in the long-term. If the loops ever suddenly&hellip; stopped, I would basically have to spend every day like I had this past week: fighting off the panic when I realize I have no clue what people are talking about because I don&rsquo;t know any of them; my stomach threatening to leap into my throat and strangle me when Jimmy did something like buy <em>her</em> a bouquet of flowers; realizing that I had forgotten the most basic fact about Christmas and now had to buy the two most important people in my life gifts in the next eighteen hours; going behind Petey&rsquo;s back and stealing the personal belongings of the members of his family; the list goes on. </p>
<p  >I heard shouting from inside the house. &ldquo;<em>Happy New Year!</em>&rdquo; I sighed; these sorts of milestones and holidays have lost so much of their meaning for me. The volume of the shouting suddenly spiked as I heard the door to the balcony slide open. I took a deep breath&mdash;time to dance. &ldquo;Hey, you missed it&mdash;the ball dropped.&rdquo; Petey snickered softly as he came up next to me to lean on the railing too and added &ldquo;Ya know, again.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I snorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only nine, what&rsquo;s everybody getting all worked up about anyhow?&rdquo; I looked askance at Petey as he giggled, shrugging. </p>
<p  >He added, &ldquo;New York isn&rsquo;t in the same time zone as California, so it&rsquo;s not like we can really do anything about it.&rdquo; He turned to face me, and it struck me again how attractive he is. Not just physically but in the way that this new Petey attracts people to him; if the old one was a lightbulb, this one was the light itself. He smiled warmly as he shrugged and added, &ldquo;Plus, we need to have something for everybody to do other than write down a list of resolutions we won&rsquo;t follow, right?&rdquo; I nodded in agreement. Right as always. We stood looking out over the dark landscape for a bit. So much of this week had been nothing <em>but</em> talking and gathering information and planning and deception; it was nice to just be able to be with him. Eventually, he turned around and leaned with his back against the railing instead, crossing his arms and frowning pensively. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve been thinking lately&hellip;&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I turned my head in his direction, raising an eyebrow as I said, &ldquo;You? <em>Thinking</em>? Who would&rsquo;ve <em>guessed</em>, Petey?&rdquo; He smiled a little bashfully but quickly resumed his earlier train of thought. </p>
<p  >Eventually he said slowly &ldquo;Have you ever thought about&hellip; what happens after the loops?&rdquo; I raised both eyebrows at that&mdash;we had never really discussed the time loops themselves, and I hadn&rsquo;t really thought about it much myself until this most recent development. </p>
<p  >I shrugged one shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&hellip; considered it.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey&rsquo;s eyebrows knit together in his &lsquo;thinking&rsquo; face, and he asked, &ldquo;Would you mind if I asked about the details?&rdquo; I &lt;wants to hide mistakes&gt; straightened up, but before I could get a word in he held up a hand and added &ldquo;Not about what happened or what you did, if you don&rsquo;t want to. Just the&hellip; I guess, mechanics of the loops?&rdquo; And Goddamn but the way he tilted his head a little when he asked that forced me to cross my arms to keep from pulling him into a hug. He&rsquo;s told me that he&rsquo;s okay with friendly, casual touching, but I really don&rsquo;t trust myself. Besides, a hug isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;d call &lsquo;casual&rsquo;. </p>
<p  >I shrugged and said, &ldquo;Ask away, Petey!&rdquo; I grinned at him and added, &ldquo;I actually like explaining the gritty details.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >He gave a lop-sided smile in reply. &ldquo;Great! Okay&hellip;&rdquo; he glanced at the door before shifting to the expression he wears when sketching. I shifted back a little&mdash;that concentration and attentiveness all directed at <em>me</em> made my recently-hyperactive sex drive start salivating in the corner. I did my best to shove it into a corner and ignore it as Petey continued talking. &ldquo;So, you said the loop ends when you die, or when you&hellip;&rdquo; He frowned before adding, &ldquo;well, I guess I figured it had something to do with sleeping?&rdquo; He looked down, now, tapping his chin in thought. &ldquo;I mean, the resets never just suddenly happen....&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I nodded in agreement. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve found. If I keep myself awake, the loop won&rsquo;t reset until I fall asleep or die.&rdquo; I started drumming my fingers on my crossed arms. I hate not having something to do with my hands when I&rsquo;m talking. </p>
<p  >He nodded vigorously. &ldquo;Okay, then&hellip;&rdquo; After a minute or so of thought, he added &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the&hellip; I guess you could call it a cutoff date&mdash;for the sleep thing? I mean, you sleep plenty and that doesn&rsquo;t cause a reset.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >My reply came pretty fast, since I&rsquo;d been thinking about this topic myself recently. &ldquo;Two or three AM on June second.&rdquo; I shrugged, adding, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of hard to know an <em>exact</em> cutoff, since it&rsquo;s usually easy enough to just stay up if I want to extend the time of the loop.&rdquo; Petey nodded, and was giving all the signs of listening attentively. I decided to sit down; maybe that&rsquo;d help hide any accidental boners. To cover up the transition to sitting, I kept talking. &ldquo;Really, what makes me think it&rsquo;s got something to do with sleep is how it never feels very different when I wake up on the day of a reset compared to any other day.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Femme Boy followed my lead, plonking himself down next to me and nodding as he processed my words. Then, he said, &ldquo;What have you tried to do to break out of the loops?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >That was the absolute last question I had expected. &ldquo;Wh&mdash;break <em>out</em>? Why would I want to do that?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey&rsquo;s face mirrored my own shock for a moment before he furrowed his brows and tilted his head again, a clear &lsquo;trying to understand Gary&rsquo;s fucked up brain&rsquo; face. &ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t you want to move on? See the&hellip; the rest of the time stream, I guess?&rdquo; He leaned back on his hands and turned his gaze to the stars in the sky. They were hard to see with the light pouring outside from the house, but still. &ldquo;I mean, think about it&hellip; we&rsquo;re technically eighteen now, and you&rsquo;re clearly already at an adult age!&rdquo; He sighed, continuing sadly, &ldquo;We should be done with high school by now, moving on to college, learning what we want to do with our lives, you know?&rdquo; I frowned, doing the math in my head. He was right about being eighteen, at least. He leaned forward suddenly, resting his chin on his hand and frowning thoughtfully at nothing in particular. &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the <em>really</em> big question; why is it happening in the first place?&rdquo; His gaze shifted from the middle distance to me as he asked, &ldquo;What do you think? Is there a reason for all this?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I shrugged. I had only rarely considered the question of &lsquo;why&rsquo; the loops were happening; usually whenever I did something exceptionally fucked-up. But that&rsquo;s just a cheap tactic for shifting the responsibility away from me&mdash;no amount of twisted pretzel-logic and existential philosophy will make the smell of Petey&rsquo;s blood or the sound of Jimmy&rsquo;s skin being sliced open any less horrifying. Besides, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not about to go questioning something that&rsquo;s basically the source of immortality, Femme Boy.&rdquo; I looked at him incredulously, adding &ldquo;If somebody woke up one day and realized that they hadn&rsquo;t aged physically since they were twenty-five, I doubt their first thought would be &lsquo;welp, time to go and kill myself!&rsquo;.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey frowned, tilting his head in a &lsquo;fair enough&rsquo; kind of gesture. He still had lingering questions, but he was interrupted by the sound of the door back into the house sliding open and <strong>some</strong>body shouting &ldquo;FUCK!&rdquo; before shutting the door again and stomping over to us. To nobody&rsquo;s surprise, Jimmy sat his ass down sporting a massively peeved expression. </p>
<p  >There was a moment&rsquo;s quiet processing before Petey rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t go well, I take it?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy stopped glaring at the dark, wooded landscape long enough to groan, &ldquo;She <em>still</em> wouldn&rsquo;t go past first fuckin&rsquo; base, man!&rdquo; before crossing his arms and inexplicably looking at me with what I swear could only be described as a &lsquo;bitches, am I right?&rsquo; expression. I gave a non-committal shrug, leaning back casually as I felt my gut roil in dismay. At least nothing had happened. </p>
<p  >Petey grimaced in much the same way he did back during the Road Trip days. &ldquo;Come on man, she&rsquo;s still my cousin. Besides, maybe you just need to let it go, you know?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Jimmy sighed, hanging his head and resting his arms on a propped-up knee. &ldquo;Yeah, I guess&hellip;&rdquo; he looked thoughtful for a moment more before whining &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just <em>sooooo</em> fine, man!&rdquo; I had to cross my arms and lean back against the railing as he began listing her various&hellip; assets; the impassivity became more difficult to maintain as the sickening dread began crawling over my skin in a horrifying perversion of the tingle that accompanies kissing someone I care about. He <em>knew</em> this girl. He had <em>planned</em> this, <em>prepared</em>! Granted, his preparations weren&rsquo;t extensive&mdash;buying a bouquet of flowers and knowing her favorite TV shows were the absolute basic minimum for me, and usually I don&rsquo;t try for anything beyond second base until I know far more about a person. But that&rsquo;s me; Jimmy never prepares for this sort of thing, it just comes so naturally to him he doesn&rsquo;t really need to. By now, he&rsquo;d transitioned to describing in excruciating detail the makeout session they had just shared and I quietly started panicking about how I was supposed to act; he was talking to us in an equally animated fashion&mdash;I was being treated as a friend, so it was my job to act like a friend would. I flipped through possible roles&mdash;should I be quiet but supportive? Offer advice? Advice to&hellip; to help him&mdash;I could actually feel bile rise a little in the back of my throat as I immediately shoved the possibility away. Closing my eyes and shaking my head, I could feel my mind spinning its wheels, but I just could not keep up after this exhausting vacation. The moron&rsquo;s voice suddenly cut through my thoughts. &ldquo;Wha&rsquo;d about you, Gary?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I flinched, forgetting myself for a moment as I replied. &ldquo;Hm? Sorry, moron, your story was so <em>fascinating</em> I couldn&rsquo;t keep my eyes open for it.&rdquo; My guts twisted in fear&mdash;shit, I shouldn&rsquo;t have injected so much venom into that. </p>
<p  >Luckily, he didn&rsquo;t seem to notice, since he laughed. A small part of me felt better at that. &ldquo;Haha, yeah, fair &lsquo;nuff!&rdquo; I smirked a little&mdash;it was the best I could do&mdash;before checking Petey&rsquo;s expression; he looked relaxed as well. As they resumed their chatting&mdash;probably another anecdote about Petey&rsquo;s childhood&mdash;for a second I envied them. Just hanging out and acting like normal teenagers is so easy for them. I had played at being normal back when Petey first convinced me to stop trying to take over the school, but even back then I was too far-gone for this stuff to feel natural to me. It was stupid of me to envy something I could never have, though. Plus, I would hardly want to take that from either of them. Over time, I found that Jimmy was willing to let me lean against him as we talked; I relished the fizzing of skin-on-skin contact. As I examined our entwined fingers, I wondered why she <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> want to do anything more with Jimmy than kiss. It was kind of stupid, in a way, to turn him down&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been with a literal fuck-ton of people and nobody even comes close to him. Then again that could just be the love talking. I smirked privately to myself, shifting to lean against him more heavily; her loss. Shortly after that, I felt him turn his head and say &ldquo;Aw, ya tired, Gar-bear?&rdquo; I sighed and shook my head against his shoulder. I&rsquo;d been using that as an excuse to get him alone a little too frequently this week&mdash;overusing it could be a problem. An arm snaked around my waist and he murmured right in my ear, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost midnight, man; you gotta wake up a little.&rdquo; Fuck, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get tired of hearing a quiet voice so close. </p>
<p  >From elsewhere, Petey piped up. &ldquo;Wait, wait; <em>Gar-bear</em>!?&rdquo; I groaned; shit, that&rsquo;s right, he hadn&rsquo;t heard Jimmy call me that. </p>
<p  >Jimmy snorted, saying, &ldquo;Haha, yep! What&rsquo;dya think?&rdquo; as he started rubbing a circle on my lower back. It didn&rsquo;t seem like it was specifically sexual or anything, just&hellip; intimate. I bit back a moan, reminding myself that Petey was sitting a fucking foot away. Instead I pressed myself closer to him; there really is something powerful about casual contact that all the blowjobs and analingus in the world can&rsquo;t match. </p>
<p  >Back in the real world, Petey was busy snickering. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good one! It&rsquo;s more creative than &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo;, at least. </p>
<p  >I turned my head so I was looking at Petey, glaring at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know that &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo; is a classic!&rdquo; I smirked and added in a knowing tone, &ldquo;Besides, have you ever tired looking up &lsquo;femboy&rsquo; on the internet, Petey?&rdquo; He frowned uncertainly, and I chuckled as I closed my eyes again. &ldquo;If you want to keep your internet use privileges, I&rsquo;d suggest not looking up images of that one, mm?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >Petey responded with an utterly dry &ldquo;Gee, thanks for the tip, Gary.&rdquo; Eventually they started moving to go inside, so I dutifully followed even though the only thing I really wanted to do was get Jimmy alone and make him forget all about that girl. As the night wore on, the adults had become a little tipsy&mdash;a couple of kids even persuaded them to let the teenagers have some alcohol. Petey abstained, of course. I didn&rsquo;t partake out of habit; keeping a clear head around drunk people makes them far easier to manipulate. Plus, I hate the holes it leaves in my memory. But Jimmy was happy to indulge, and soon he was clearly buzzed. Not falling-over drunk, but he was louder than normal. As was the girl. I hung back with Petey, who was busy listening to the ramblings of his uncle. Soon the real countdown to midnight began; I couldn&rsquo;t tear my eyes away as they shared one of those clich&eacute; Happy New Year kisses, which ramped things up way faster than the makeout session he&rsquo;d described before. Soon she was dragging Jimmy downstairs, much to his clear delight. I fixed my gaze on the ceiling and tried to tune into what Petey was saying; I&rsquo;d <em>known</em> this was coming, so getting worked up about it was really fucking stupid. </p>
<p  >But Petey was absorbed in his conversation with a drunk history graduate student, and seeing him look at somebody else with that absolute focus&hellip; the jealousy just made me think of Jimmy. What was he doing with her? Probably more than making out, judging by the flush I&rsquo;d seen on his cheeks. Though that could&rsquo;ve been the booze. </p>
<p  >That thought made me perk up. I haven&rsquo;t done much drinking myself, but people tended to act much more cheerfully after alcohol. Hm. I risked a glance at Petey, but he was still holding a lively discourse. Rising from the couch, I asked casually &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m gonna get something to drink. Want anything?&rdquo; He just shook his head, but nodded his thanks as I walked away. </p>
<p  >Time to see how much it would take to forget about what was no doubt happening a floor below. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~Chapter 28:   Gary, <em>Stop</em>  !~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when Cheryl kissed me at midnight, even though she was kinda being whatever about it earlier&mdash;a lotta girls like doing romantic stuff like kissing under the mistletoe or after seeing shooting stars and stuff. Doesn&rsquo;t mean jack shit, but if it gets me makeouts with hot chicks I&rsquo;m not about to start complaining. What <em>did</em> surprise me was when she moved my hand onto her tits. She was also using way more tongue than earlier, and&hellip; oooh shit; I moaned a little when she started squeezing my butt. Maybe it was the booze talking but my pants were feeling tighter by the second as I tried to focus on feeling her rack, making out, not grabbing her hair too hard, <em>and</em> enjoying the dainty hands that were now getting much friskier. Not Gary levels of eager, but this girl clearly wanted some. When we finally pulled back for air, her lipstick had been smeared pretty badly; especially when she licked her lips before giving this coy little smirk and fuuuuck that was hot. Shit, Gary does the same thing all the time but the slightly-mussed hair framing her face and the full lips and the soft skin really made me want to try and see just how messy I could get her to look. Then she started pulling me over to the stairs, leaning in and whispering&hellip; well I could make out &lsquo;quiet&rsquo; and &lsquo;alone&rsquo;, and she had some &lsquo;fuck me&rsquo; eyes like <em>whoa</em>, which was good enough for me. </p>
<p  >As we went down the stairs and she turned to watch where she was going, I glanced over toward Pete and Gary. I wasn&rsquo;t really sure why I did that, and looking back I dunno know what I&rsquo;d expected, but either way my ear-splitting grin faltered a little at how neither of &lsquo;em were looking my way. Gary in particular looked&hellip; I squinted, but all I could make out was that he was sitting <em>really</em> still before the stairwell was blocking my view. I shrugged and looked back at Cheryl&rsquo;s <em>really awesome</em> ass. &lsquo;Snot like he&rsquo;s my problem. </p>
<p  >Eventually we got to the bathroom downstairs and after hastily locking the door I was pulling that girl&rsquo;s shirt off in record fucking time. She was quick to undo the hook on her bra, and <em>fuck</em> that was a great rack. I honestly meant to ask if it was okay first, but the time between getting the idea to start sucking on her tits and my mouth actually being on her tits was wayyy shorter if I just did it. Man, none of the girls at Bullworth have boobs like this! But she squeaked when I sucked her nipple, pushing me away. I shook my head &ldquo;Shit, &lsquo;m sorry, should&rsquo;a assed&mdash;&rdquo; I&rsquo;d gotten so used to Gary&rsquo;s preference for all the fucking stimulation that I was losing my edge a bit when it came to other people. Knew I didn&rsquo;t have anything to worry about when she just kissed me, though. I smiled before looking around to consider the room. &ldquo;So&hellip;&rdquo; I put both hands on her hips before sliding them down to squeeze her ass through that skirt. She smiled, blushing a ton while I steered us toward a wall. I added in my sexy voice, &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you into, girlie?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t grind on her when we reached the wall like I would&rsquo;ve if it were Gary. Hell, if it was Gary hands would&rsquo;ve already been down pants. But he&rsquo;s super used to sex&mdash;hell, dude&rsquo;s got centuries worth of experience. From what I could tell, Cheryl wasn&rsquo;t a total newbie, but new enough to be kind of nervous about it. I mean, that playing hard to-get routine she pulls each year is kinda annoying, but I get it; a lotta people do something similar when they&rsquo;re scared. So I didn&rsquo;t want to push her into anything before she was comfortable. </p>
<p  >She licked her lips and bit them while she watched the door before answering quietly. &ldquo;&hellip;Well. I&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never had anybody touch my&hellip; you know.&rdquo; I smirked a little, looking down as I moved one of the hands I had on her ass to trail along her inner thigh. She squeaked again, but this time it was followed up by a moan. Oh, that was a green light if I ever saw it. </p>
<p  >I leaned in and started kissing under her jaw&mdash;a bit of a gamble, since some people really like that and others really don&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Heh, alright. Do ya wanna touch mine?&rdquo; She moved her head away&mdash;guess not&mdash;so I pulled back and moved my other hand to join the one between her legs, running over the tights she was wearing. I added &ldquo;&lsquo;S cool if you don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; I said it kinda automatically, since I was busy enjoyin&rsquo; the show. She shook her head even while she let out some high-pitched notes and general moaning. Guess <em>some</em>body thinks porn stars&rsquo; moaning is what sex actually sounds like. But I just said &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine; let&rsquo;s give that pussy of yours some love, hm?&rdquo; I started running my hands more decisively over her crotch&mdash;I could already feel a little wetness, and she gasped. <em>Nice</em>. Lifting up her skirt so I could see what I was doing, I said lowly, &ldquo;Hey, can you put your foot up here?&rdquo; and pointed to the toilet. As I started toying with the top of her stockings, I explained &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be able to touch more of you if your legs are spread,&rdquo; Newbies usually need to have somebody talk them through it. She did, so I tugged her tights fully down and purred &ldquo;<em>Good</em> girl&hellip;&rdquo; as I moved from outside the tights to inside, now rubbing against her panties. She made a bunch of sound since the thin fabric was already pretty soaked through. It had been a long time since I&rsquo;d last touched pussy; I&rsquo;d forgotten how awesome it is! The faint squishing sound when I pressed my hand into the warm, wet folds of skin was wayyy hotter than any of the stupid sounds this girl was trying to turn me on with. Leaning closer to her, I whispered in her ear &ldquo;Might wanna keep it down, sweetie; people&rsquo;ll be comin&rsquo; down here to go to sleep soon.&rdquo; That shut her up a bit. She was still making a bunch of weird mewls and whimpers, but that was her business. I just focused on exploring her clit; I started by rubbing my whole hand over her, making sure it was nice and wet. Switching to two fingers, I trailed it along one cloth-covered flap of skin before circling her clit. She whined and tightened her grip on my waist and neck at that, so I stroked it teasingly before moving my hand away and going back down the other lip of her pussy. &ldquo;Want some more?&rdquo; Opening her eyes, she licked her lips a little before locking eyes with me and nodding. I grinned, and said &ldquo;Awesome&mdash;then why don&rsquo;tchya help me get your tights off?&rdquo; She nodded again, and&mdash;with my help&mdash;pulled one of her legs out of the stockings. Now able to spread herself a lot wider, the lips of her vag went wider than her underwear. I grinned, leaning forward and sinking my hand into the dripping folds of flesh, using the other hand to keep the panties out of the way. She let out an exaggerated moan and I rolled my eyes. Seriously, why some girls feel the need to pretend to be loud has always been beyond me. Still, my slacks were tight as fucking hell by now. As I opened the zipper, I asked in a pretty hoarse voice, &ldquo;You look <em>real</em> good&hellip; d&rsquo;jya mind if I join you?&rdquo; </p>
<p  >She&rsquo;d started shifting her hips forward into my hand a bit, and after seeing me unbutton my jeans she nodded despite her bit lip. I grunted and added my other hand to the mix for a bit before sticking my left hand down my pants. I&rsquo;m not used to jerking off with my left hand, but the fresh lube felt soooo much better than just spit or lotion. By now she&rsquo;d stopped the bullshit moaning and was making way more genuine-sounding sounds, which was better, at least. We were close by now, and I wondered if I should finger her. But most girls don&rsquo;t come from penetration anyway, and I would&rsquo;ve had to use two hands to get her off&mdash;which meant not stroking myself. Ha, fuck that! To my surprise, I finished first. I slowed down as I came, and got an earful of whining while I caught my breath. But she was so sensitive after the pause that she orgasmed not long after I started up again, and all I could hear was panting. </p>
<p  >Then the talking started. &ldquo;Haha, wow! That was&hellip; just&hellip;&rdquo; I nodded, not that that&rsquo;d been mind-blowing or anything. We spent the next while cleaning up after ourselves. I thought she was talking a lot for somebody who&rsquo;d said almost nothing while having sex; I frowned a little as I mopped cum out of my pants with a washcloth. I&rsquo;d been working to get with this girl for a couple years&mdash;er, loops&mdash;now, but now that I&rsquo;d done it I didn&rsquo;t feel very accomplished. &lsquo;Course it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m sad about this or anything; it&rsquo;d been plenty fun! But&hellip; well, it just wasn&rsquo;t like it is with Gary. Being with Gary is like a really good fight; by the end, you&rsquo;re sweaty and panting and probably bruised as fuck but grinning anyway. Being with Cheryl was totally casual&mdash;just standard swappin&rsquo; fluids. </p>
<p  >I waved her to go upstairs without me; had to take a piss. As I peed, I had a thought; am I in love with the psycho or something?&nbsp; Shaking my dick before tucking back in, I compared it to the crushes I&rsquo;d had in the past; this&hellip; thing with Gary doesn&rsquo;t feel as silly as a crush, though. I jogged over to the stairs, thinking how Gary&rsquo;s kinda more than just a friend, or an enemy, or a fuck-buddy&mdash;he&rsquo;s sort of &lt;note: Jimmy apparently doesn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;sorta&rsquo;&mdash;just &lsquo;sort of&rsquo;, according to the fan wiki&gt; on-par with Pete; like&hellip; some relationship that&rsquo;s close but not in like a creepy way? I couldn&rsquo;t think of a good word. Maybe that&rsquo;s why fucking is so much more intense with Gary than anybody else? I shrugged as I re-entered the party, tabling the super-personal, deep dive into my mind for later. </p>
<p  >Things were winding down now. Pete was arguing with Dick, which had become a common sight these days, and I could see Cheryl and her friend Maggie giggling quietly in the corner. Eh, I didn&rsquo;t wanna deal with her quite yet. Luckily, I heard Gary&rsquo;s voice drifting over from the kitchen, so I wandered over there. As I turned the corner, I could tell he was in lecture-mode, pouring something from a pitcher into a mug as he talked. &ldquo;The real key is familiarity; you see children, the more information you have the more power you have over somebody,&rdquo; He turned around, crossing his arms as he braced his back against the counter. A couple of kids were listening to him like he was the most important person ever&mdash;I just rolled my eyes. What kinda bullshit lies was he tellin&rsquo; them <em>now</em>? </p>
<p  >One of the boys&mdash;he looked about Pedro&rsquo;s age&mdash;piped up and said &ldquo;But&hellip; how do you know all this anyway? Could&hellip; could you <em>show</em> us?&rdquo; While he was asking, Gary&rsquo;s eyes flicked over to me as he sipped his drink. </p>
<p  >He placed the mug on the counter, smirking at the kid. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d be happy to!&rdquo; Here he leaned over and wrapped an arm around my waist, yanking me over so I was standing next to him as he said, &ldquo;Take Jimmy-boy for example....&rdquo; The sudden movement made the whole fuckin room spin&mdash;shit, the booze must&rsquo;ve worn off by now. He began poking my side, saying &ldquo;See, you want to aim between the seventh and eighth ribs on the left for a quick kill,&rdquo; He shrugged as he threw his arm over my shoulder, adding, &ldquo;Well, that applies to a lot of people, but with Jimmy you need to catch him off-guard if you really want to murder him properly,&rdquo; I turned my head to gape at him; what the fuck? Why was he talking about this with <em>kids</em>!? </p>
<p  >I glanced over to the kids and started hissing, &ldquo;What the fuck are you do&ndash;&rdquo; But Gary&rsquo;d already started licking my mouth. I could feel him smirk as the kids started exclaiming in disgust, but I was more worried about how Scarface tasted. I frowned before finally identifying the flavor, and I popped my eyes open as I leaned away. &ldquo;Shit, are you <em>drunk</em>?&rdquo; Sure, I&rsquo;d been drinking earlier too, but Gary tasted like a fucking booze factory. </p>
<p  >He shrugged, but then the same kid who&rsquo;d asked him to &lsquo;show&rsquo; interrupted. &ldquo;Ew, that&rsquo;s so gross!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >A younger one nodded, looking at how Gary&rsquo;d kinda draped himself over me in disgust and adding &ldquo;Yeah&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it weird when boys kiss other boys?&rdquo; I narrowed my eyes; who the hell was telling these kids this shit? I don&rsquo;t know &lsquo;em too well but they seem alright.... </p>
<p  >Gary beat me to the punch, though. &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve got much of a choice,&rdquo; He paused to take a swig from his mug, which I started eyeing. I started thinking maaaaybe I shouldn&rsquo;t let Gary drink anymore when he reached for the pitcher as he talked. &ldquo;What, you&rsquo;ve never heard of a broken heart?&rdquo; The kids nodded, and he continued &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s not just an expression, it&rsquo;s a real medical condition,&rdquo; I pried the pitcher out of his hand before he had the chance to pour any more. Luckily, he just shrugged and continued as I peered at the liquid. What the hell <em>was</em> this stuff? &ldquo;See, if you don&rsquo;t kiss somebody you love every day, your heart actually breaks,&rdquo; I snapped my head up to stare at Gary wide-eyed, but the psycho acted like what he just said wasn&rsquo;t weird at all! &ldquo;See, your heart is actually a muscle, and it&rsquo;s usually lined with tissue, but if you don&rsquo;t treat it regularly the tissue gets thinner and thinner,&rdquo; What the hell? Since when was he in <em>love</em> with me!? Suddenly he grabbed my arm, yanking forward so we were pressed chest-to-chest; nothing new&mdash;but the cold metallic object being dragged across my neck was. I froze, now <em>really fuckin&rsquo; conscious</em> of the fact that the crazy, drunk person holding a knife to my throat had been totally willing to slit my throat when I first met him. Right next to my ear, he said quietly &ldquo;And that, children, is how you murder Jimmy Hopkins.&rdquo; </p>
<p  >I felt the same icy fear I&rsquo;d felt nearly constantly for the first week of being kidnapped as I looked into Gary&rsquo;s eyes. Holy <em>fuck</em> I had not been expecting this! I swallowed as I pushed him away very, <em>very</em> slowly. It didn&rsquo;t stop him from staring with some creepy, detached curiosity at the knife he was still drawing up and down my neck. &ldquo;Haha, um&hellip; really funny, Gary,&rdquo; Oddly enough, he stepped back immediately. </p>
<p  >He scooped up his mug, knife still in-hand, and began re-filling it as he spoke. &ldquo;Anyway, that&rsquo;s what they mean when they say &lsquo;knowledge is power&rsquo;,&rdquo; I blinked, completely blind-sighted by the sudden shift in topic. The hell? He set the pitcher down (shit I didn&rsquo;t even notice him take it), tossing the knife and catching it casually in one hand as he brought the cup to his lips. Sipping thoughtfully, he added, &ldquo;Though, I think it&rsquo;s much more <em>accurate</em> to say that &lsquo;ignorance is weakness&rsquo;,&rdquo; I shook my head as Scarface began downing more of.. whatever it was. Shit, what the fuck? Apparently Gary being drunk is the fucking doomsday scenario&mdash;he needed to get to bed, now. </p>
<p  >I grimaced as I felt another headache coming on; of <em>course</em> I gotta be the fucking responsible one again. I quietly got the drink out of his hand and said as softly as I could &ldquo;Hey babe, I think maybe you should go to bed?&rdquo; The psycho&rsquo;s gaze had locked onto me the second I started talking; weird, his expression&rsquo;s way easier to read when he&rsquo;s drunk. He was surprised at first before shifting to sad acceptance. Still, he nodded as I set the mug on the counter. Now the tricky part&mdash;fuck my heart was pounding like crazy. I locked onto his eyes and held out my hand. &ldquo;How &lsquo;bout givin&rsquo; me that knife, hm? I don&rsquo;t want&rsquo;chya to hurt anyone....&rdquo; I swear to God, if he hurt somebody I would fucking kill him as soon as he was sober! </p>
<p  >He smiled at that, saying, &ldquo;Aw, that&rsquo;s sweet of you, Jimmy-boy,&rdquo; as he laid the handle of the knife in my hand. I quickly stuck it back in the kitchen-knife block before turning back to the kids as I grabbed his wrist. </p>
<p  >&ldquo;Yeah, um.. maybe can you guys not mention this to your parents?&rdquo; They nodded&mdash;their expressions were a little dazed. Couldn&rsquo;t blame &lsquo;em; I&rsquo;m used to Gary&rsquo;s.. well, whatever, but it still wipes me out. I smiled at them as his arms wrapped around my shoulders; they didn&rsquo;t seem like bad kids. </p>
<p  >As we made our way back to the stairwell, Gary attached himself to my waist and started trying to hug me to death. Damn, he&rsquo;s really got a strong grip. Suddenly it loosened, and I could feel hands moving up to my neck as he began lapping at my throat. I exhaled sharply; ooh that felt good. I shook my head&mdash;shit, I did <em>not</em> want to fucking deal with a drunk Gary trying to make out with me right now! </p>
<p  >We&rsquo;d made it to the second landing, and I had to put a hand on his forehead and push him away a little. &ldquo;Dude, you&rsquo;re fucking drunk off your <em>ass</em>. You&rsquo;re not even gonna remember this tomorrow, man,&rdquo; At least, I hoped he wouldn&rsquo;t. Damn, he didn&rsquo;t even stumble when we made it to the bottom. &ldquo;Shit man, how are you even standing? You taste like you&ndash;&rdquo; But he interrupted me by shoving me against the wall and jamming his tongue in my mouth again. I responded without even thinking about it; drunk or not, Gary&rsquo;s still a damn good kisser. </p>
<p  >But it didn&rsquo;t have his usual&hellip; structure, I guess. Usually he kisses almost like a robot, all coldly analyzing what I react to and replicating it; which is kina hot in its own way. Right now, though, everything about how he was licking all around my mouth and sucking on me and not even bothering to avoid clacking our teeth together screamed desperation. Shiiit this wasn&rsquo;t good&hellip; I turned my head away, &ldquo;uh, hold up&hellip;&rdquo; so he started nipping and sucking my neck. Ohhh yeaaaah. What I&rsquo;d been about to say turned into, &ldquo;&hellip;yyooou mmmm ahhhh~..&rdquo; Shit, he&rsquo;s so goood. He nudged my head up, giving his tongue more access as he lightly gnawed at the side of my neck. Hot hands started slipping under my shirt&mdash;too hot, and I could smell the booze on his breath from here. Gah, <em>focus</em>! I shook my head a little and muttered, &ldquo;Gary, fuck, wait&mdash;you&ndash;&rdquo; but then a hand started massaging my crotch <em>just</em> how I like. &ldquo;AHhh! Wha-mmmmmm Go-God, hang on..&rdquo; I gripped his shirt harder, fighting the urge to pull him closer to hump his leg. </p>
<p  >But he ignored me, scraping his teeth against my neck as he said breathlessly, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move to the bedroom, hm? Would you like that?&rdquo; I squeezed my eyes shut; fuck, I had to get it together! I gasped as he started expertly tonguing my ear and quietly panting, &ldquo;Is that what you want? Please, just tell me what you want..&rdquo; Goddamnit, Gary is <em>not</em> in his right mind, I can&rsquo;t let this fuckin&rsquo; happen! I started to move my hands up to his shoulders to push him back, but then he muttered, &ldquo;Or perhaps.. you would prefer the <em>bath</em>room?&rdquo; And something about the way he&rsquo;d said &lsquo;bathroom&rsquo; made me stop. I could feel his expression twist to something far nastier, but when he pulled back to make eye-contact, he looked sad more than anything. He turned around toward the far wall, and I automatically followed his gaze. &ldquo;Ah, so <em>that&rsquo;s</em> where you and your ladyfriend slipped off to.&rdquo; Oh&hellip; <strong><em>fuck</em></strong>! The door to where Cheryl and I had.. uh, just been was open a little, and I could see the towel that I&rsquo;d used to clean up. I flicked my eyes back to Gary&mdash;he was staring at the door, but I couldn&rsquo;t see his face from here. </p>
<p  >Crap&hellip; was he <em>jealous</em>? Man, I didn&rsquo;t know that was against the rules of our &lsquo;thing&rsquo;. &ldquo;Shit.. Gary, I&rsquo;m&ndash;&rdquo; but then he went back to stroking my crotch. &ldquo;&ndash;soooohhh~ fuck!&rdquo; </p>
<p  >In the haze, I heard him saying a bunch of stuff under his breath as he leaned in and started planting kisses all over my face and neck and shoulders. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care I don&rsquo;t care I don&rsquo;t care....&rdquo; I thrust my hips automatically when he put even more pressure right on the tip of my dick. Fucking <em>hell</em> that was distracting! Then, pulling himself together, he took a deep breath and began whispering, &ldquo;Jimmy, just.. <em>please</em>&hellip; I will do <strong>anything</strong> for you, just don&rsquo;t.. God, don&rsquo;t leave me..&rdquo; Then he was kissing me on the lips again and oh fuck that&rsquo;s right he&rsquo;s fucking drunk. </p>
<p  >I gritted my teeth and finally grabbed his hands, yanking them out of my pants. &ldquo;Gary, <em>stop</em>! Fucking.. fucking stop. Okay?&rdquo; he froze as I took a couple of deep breaths. Shit, I&rsquo;m not used to stopping in the thick of things. I let out a breath, trying to choose my words carefully. &ldquo;You.. look, you gotta go sleep this off&mdash;you&rsquo;re not thinkin&rsquo; like you normally would,&rdquo; I squirmed away, but kept the grip I had on his wrist, walking more decisively. Fucking Christ, note to self to keep Gary as far away from booze as possible! I dragged him past the bathroom to what Pete&rsquo;s relatives called &lsquo;the playroom&rsquo;, which was full of sleeping bags for all the kids. As soon as the door was open, I breathed a sigh of relief. Good, managed to do that at least. I stepped back, checking how he was as I said, &ldquo;Okay, you go and get, uh, comfy&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be right back with some food and water, okay?&rdquo; He was <em>staring</em> again&hellip; shit, was he headed for another mental breakdown? </p>
<p  >Above me, I heard the kids start coming down the stairs as I pulled him in for a hug. &ldquo;Hey, come on, you&rsquo;re okay. I&rsquo;ll get Pete, and we can stay up with you and chat for a while, &lsquo;kay?&rdquo; I pulled back as the footsteps reached the landing and I could hear some brat whining down the hallway. He still wasn&rsquo;t responding, though&hellip; I shook his shoulder hard, kinda shouting, &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; That got a reaction at least; his eyes squeezed shut, and he nodded, expression still blank. &ldquo;Oh, okay. Cool. So&hellip; yep.&rdquo; I clapped him on the shoulder as I walked past, not really sure what else to say. Really could&rsquo;ve used Pete&rsquo;s help for this kinda thing. </p>
<p  >Speaking of which; I passed the woman herding the kids into the bathroom for brushing their teeth and started making my way up the stairs, trying to massage the already-growing headache away. Pete&rsquo;d better have a fucking AMAZING excuse for why he&rsquo;d let Gary get that fucking hammered. </p>
<p > ~~~~~~  Chapter 29:  ~~~~~~ </p>
<p  >To say that I felt like I was falling was generous. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d felt earlier, when I hadn&rsquo;t yet absorbed the full implication of what this meant. Like the ground had disappeared out from under me; tumbling through a void of uncertainty and confusion. But it turned out that the ground didn&rsquo;t vanish&mdash;it had moved to a much lower elevation, and I&rsquo;d slammed into it when Jimmy and Pete had finally left me alone and let me &lsquo;go to sleep&rsquo;. Being broken felt a lot worse than being trapped in free-fall; At least that was sort of fun if you viewed it in a detached way. Right now my head felt like it had an axe implanted in it, and my skin was cold and clammy. I was so dizzy walking in a straight line was quickly becoming a chore and I&rsquo;d already emptied the contents of my stomach into the toilet. My arms shook horribly as I tried to support my head over the toilet bowl, gulping down air as I tried to ignore the little voice in the back of my head that had suddenly been amplified three-fold to a booming scream. It wanted to know where and how they&rsquo;d fucked&mdash;maybe she&rsquo;d spread herself right here as he stuck his dick in her pussy. I scrambled away from the toilet like it was on fire, but then it said ooh, maybe she sucked him off in the shower and I had to get away from that too. In the end I was left huddled in the middle of the bathroom, trembling as I tried to shut the voice out. </p>
<p  >He&rsquo;d pushed me away. He had <em>never</em> said no before. My memory from a few hours ago was a little spotty but him telling me to stop kept ringing through my brain; &ldquo;Gary, <strong>stop</strong>!&rdquo; My skin felt like it had hundreds of ants crawling underneath it, and I grabbed at it but my hands were shaking too much to really rip it off. The voice laughed at the desperate claw marks that I&rsquo;d begun making with my nails. It was quick to remind me that I had <em>known</em> this was coming, even before I&rsquo;d realized I was in love with him! Ha, back when I had fooled myself into thinking it was just a physical thing; sex has never been just a physical exercise for me. I heard it again &ldquo;Gary, STOP!&rdquo; my head was going to fucking explode oh God it was like with Petey all over again how the hell did I let it happen again!? My stomach lurched more as I rolled on my side and clutched at my head&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t go near the toilet, I kept picturing them&hellip; So instead I threw up all over myself and the bathroom floor. Brilliant. I panted, my arms still shaking as I knelt on the ground. Shit, I needed to get out of here and make a plan. That thought let me get to my feet and stumble out of the room; planning was familiar, planning was <em>safe</em>. The world spun around me as I stood in the hallway, trying to decide where to go. I decided on the kitchen&mdash;it was away from Jimmy, and Petey, and&hellip; <em>her</em>. </p>
<p  >It was a fucking miracle I got up those stairs, honestly. I finally stumbled into the kitchen and grasped the counter to hold myself up. Okay. Good; I was somewhere, at least. As I caught my breath, my eye fell on the block of kitchen knives lit up by a strip of moonlight. Wow, that was almost poetic. I <em>could</em> end it temporarily, at least. Still, though&hellip; I suspect that part of why Petey was so against me killing myself was because of how messy it was. Probably scared him. &hellip;but another beat of my heart brought another pulse of splitting pain in my skull and images of Jimmy with his head buried between her breasts and thighs. As the wave of crushing loneliness passed, I considered the fact that this wasn&rsquo;t really about Petey; it was about Jimmy. And if anything, Jimmy had said that he <em>wished</em> I&rsquo;d killed myself that one time. Bracing my arms on the counter, I nodded slowly. So I could kill myself because he had said I could. Okay, at least I had a plan now. But stabbing myself was out of the question if Petey didn&rsquo;t like it. Hm. What was a way for me to die that didn&rsquo;t involve any major outward signs of trauma? </p>
<p  >My eyes roved around the kitchen until they fell on the sink: drowning was one&mdash;didn&rsquo;t trust myself to stay underwater, though. An electrical outlet might leave burn marks, or start a fire, so nope. Finally, I spotted a half-full glass of wine somebody&rsquo;d left out. Hm&hellip; come to think of it&hellip; had I ever died by alcohol poisoning? My memory of last night may be patchy, but I could remember everything else just fine, and that was definitely not on my list of completed deaths. And it wouldn&rsquo;t leave any outward sign of trauma! Perfect: I grabbed the glass of wine and downed it. Funny enough, as the substance went down my throat, the pulsing pain in my head lessened a little. Must be a good sign. </p>
<p  >A few minutes later, I&rsquo;d found a bottle of tequila and was sipping it slowly. I felt way better&mdash;and I suddenly got a fantastic idea. I began grinning and grabbed the phone, beginning to dial. </p>
<p  >&nbsp; </p>



<p >~~~~~~  </p>
<p >&lt;Chapter incomplete&gt; &lt;Continue workshopping&mdash;need to figure out end&gt;  </p>
<p >The drive back to Bullworth was pretty much silent the whole way. We weren&rsquo;t called on to give directions this time around, thank God. Jimmy had gotten in a lot of trouble with the adults when he&rsquo;d up and told the kids in the house that Gary was dead, but I was kind of proud of him for saying it. The two of us were sitting next to each other in the back of the car, but there wasn&rsquo;t really anything to say&hellip; so the majority of the ride passed in silence. At one point, though, I found myself saying &ldquo;I thought&hellip; I really thought he was doing better&hellip;&rdquo; Jimmy nodded, still staring out the window with his arms crossed.  </p>
<p >The silence returned in full force, leaving me to think stomach-churning thoughts about how I should&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on him! How could I have let Gary go and do that? God, and it wasn&rsquo;t as if I&rsquo;d only turned my back for a second and he suddenly vanished; I&rsquo;d just stopped paying attention, that was all there was to it. I was startled out of my stupor a little when Jimmy suddenly growled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to <strong>fucking</strong> kill him when we get back.&rdquo; I blinked&mdash;what did he mean? Gary wouldn&rsquo;t suddenly show up just because we get back to Bullw&ndash;I blinked again, realizing he meant that this wasn&rsquo;t permanent. Technically he <em>would</em> be back after the reset. But the image of Gary&rsquo;s body covered with a white cloth being carried away on a stretcher and reeking of vomit still sent a wave of nausea through me.  </p>
<p >I crossed my arms, sighing and saying quietly, &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I&rsquo;m with you on that one.&rdquo; Jimmy snorted, but a few moments later he began leaning against me. I was surprised to find that he was shaking a little; I attempted a comforting pat on the arm, but physical comfort isn&rsquo;t really my strong suit. The rest of the ride home passed in silence.  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >This time around it seemed even more ridiculous that life in Bullworth continued normally. We went back to living in the dorms, and resumed our classes, and ate lunch and stuff. But Gary&rsquo;s absence was, for lack of a better term, like a presence&mdash;when he&rsquo;d killed himself the first time, I&rsquo;d mostly been glad he was gone. Jimmy had too, as far as I could tell&mdash;we&rsquo;d just tried to get back to our lives that time around. Plus we&rsquo;d just lived through a school year without him, so it felt normal that he wasn&rsquo;t there. Now, though, we&rsquo;d actually lost somebody we cared about. And I kept telling myself (and Jimmy) that we&rsquo;d be seeing him again in five months, but it never changed how weird History class felt without Gary obnoxiously mouthing everything the teacher was saying word-for-word, or how empty lunch felt without the occasional snide comment from him. Jimmy spent the first week of school being weirdly prickly, picking fights at every opportunity. He insisted that it wasn&rsquo;t about Gary, but it didn&rsquo;t escape my notice that he started carrying the iPod Gary&rsquo;d gotten him for Christmas around with him everywhere.&lt;I was surprised I wasn&rsquo;t doing the same thing, honestly&gt;   </p>
<p>~~~  </p>
<p >It was late in the week, and I was wandering around New Coventry&mdash;originally I&rsquo;d been planning on going to Blue Skies, but decided against it at the last second. I didn&rsquo;t really have any projects I wanted to do at the moment. My dazed wandering was interrupted by somebody yelling &ldquo;Hey! Hey, pink-shirt kid!&rdquo; I looked around, and was surprised to see Duncan jogging over to me. He stopped for a breath when he reached my side before adding &ldquo;Hey, sorry&mdash;forgot yer name.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I smiled and waved a hand dismissively. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it; I&rsquo;m just happy to see a friendly face!&rdquo; Duncan had his winter jacket on instead of the usual muscle shirt, and I was relieved he was smiling.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Aw, I just&hellip; shit, I heard what happened.&rdquo; His face turned serious and he shuffled his feet when I nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m, uh&hellip; sorry?&rdquo; He shook his head, saying &ldquo;Crap you&rsquo;re probably hearin&rsquo; that from everybody, huh kid?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >After a moment&rsquo;s thought, I shook my head. &ldquo;Actually, nobody&rsquo;s really mentioned it to me&hellip;&rdquo; I laughed a little dryly, adding &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people really know me, anyway.&rdquo; Duncan curled his lip, shaking his head.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Guess some things don&rsquo;t fuckin&rsquo; change. Goddamn that school.&rdquo; I shrugged; he had a point. &ldquo;Anyway, look man&hellip; you need a place to crash, or just&hellip; I dunno, wanna hang, I&rsquo;ll, uh put in a good word with my friends&mdash;make sure they know you&rsquo;re cool, yaknow?&rdquo; It seemed like Duncan was a little embarrassed to be saying all this, since he checked around the area and moved to stand closer to me as he said it.  </p>
<p >Even so, I was very touched. &ldquo;Wow! That&rsquo;s so nice of you, but you really don&rsquo;t need to do that.&rdquo; I hated to obligate anyone to protect me; Jimmy used to do the same thing back before (and especially after) the Road Trip.  </p>
<p >The other boy shook his head, though. &ldquo;Nah, don&rsquo;t sweat it kid. Er&hellip;&rdquo; here he opened his eyes and looked down at me &ldquo;Uh&hellip; what was your name again?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I grinned, and stuck my hand out for a handshake. &ldquo;Peter Kowalski! My friends call me Pete, though.&rdquo; Except Gary of course, but he is usually an exception.  </p>
<p >Duncan looked a little wary of the handshake but gave a small shrug and accepted my hand. &ldquo;Duncan Tetzloff!&rdquo; He laughed at my expression. &ldquo;Yeah, you should see when people try &lsquo;n spell it.&rdquo; I laughed, but I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what else to say, so I said my good-byes.&lt;&gt;  </p>
<p >Eventually, I returned to school and checked my mail automatically, and was surprised to find something in my inbox&mdash;it looked like a super fancy letter, too! I blinked at the return address&mdash;Smith Manor. Huh. Ripping it open, it was an invitation to Gary&rsquo;s funeral. Holy crap&hellip; I flipped the paper over, but it didn&rsquo;t seem like a joke. I <em>know</em> we didn&rsquo;t get invited last time&mdash;I frowned; Gary must&rsquo;ve gotten us invitations. Shit, I had to go find Jimmy.  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >&ldquo;FUCK. NO.&rdquo; I sighed; this was seriously testing my patience.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Jimmy, come <em>on</em>!&rdquo; I waved our invitations at him again as I reiterated &ldquo;He obviously wants us to go!&rdquo; He was glaring at me as he stuffed his hands in his pockets.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Yeah, well fuck him.&rdquo; Deep breath, Pete. Just think for a second. I scanned him as he scowled at the floor. He looked mad, but mostly he just seemed hurt. I reached a hand out and put it on his shoulder, but he flinched away from the contact, turning on his heel and stomping out of his room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not FUCKING going, Pete!&rdquo; I followed him out of the dorm, stuffing our invitations in my back pocket. As I pulled up next to him he said &ldquo;I said I&rsquo;m not going!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I nodded. &ldquo;I know, I just thought you might want some company on whatever misadventures you&rsquo;re going on.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He raised an eyebrow as we walked out the gates of the school. &ldquo;Really, Pete? <em>You</em> wanna help me put the beat-down on some Greasers?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I sighed; I didn&rsquo;t, really. But I could handle it. Besides, &ldquo;I did wanna talk to&hellip; uh&hellip;&rdquo; Crap. I hit my head, trying to remember the Greaser&rsquo;s name who started with an R&hellip; &ldquo;Ricky!&rdquo; I really don&rsquo;t get why names are so hard for me to remember. It&rsquo;s kind of silly.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s a buddy of yours, right?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I shrugged. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been talking to me about his girlfriend a lot. Sounds like the breakup&rsquo;s really bothering him. And his family doesn&rsquo;t have enough healthcare to pay for a psychiatrist so....&rdquo; This town really is fucked up. It&rsquo;s like everybody somehow forgot how to care about other people.  </p>
<p >Jimmy punched me in the arm affectionately, saying &ldquo;Geez, Pete, what&rsquo;re you tryin&rsquo; to do, fix everybody&rsquo;s problems?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Hm&hellip; that kind of related to what we were talking about earlier. &ldquo;All I can do is be there for somebody who needs it.&rdquo; How could I bring it around to Gary? Jimmy grunted, but didn&rsquo;t respond beyond that, so I took the opportunity to elaborate. &ldquo;Look. I <em>know</em> you don&rsquo;t wanna go.&rdquo; He flinched, but didn&rsquo;t interrupt me as we passed the motel. &ldquo;I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t really want to go much either. But you gotta help yourself, you know? Give yourself some closure or&hellip; something.&rdquo; We passed under the entry to New Coventry, and Jimmy just grunted. After a moment, I nudged him and added &ldquo;Besides, there&rsquo;ll be plenty of rich jerks to prank!&rdquo; I grinned when he glanced my way for just a second&mdash;haha, knew that&rsquo;d get his attention. &ldquo;Tell you what, if you go you can bring a sharpie and draw something on Gary&rsquo;s face before they bury him, alright?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Jimmy snorted at that, adding &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >&ldquo;I dunno, you could&hellip; you could draw a penis on his face. Or write &lsquo;I love to eat horse dicks&rsquo; or something.&rdquo; He was full-on laughing now.  </p>
<p >He slapped me on the back, saying &ldquo;Jesus, Pete! How is it you&rsquo;re so nice but you&rsquo;ve got like the weirdest sense of humor?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >That made me snort. &ldquo;Haha, I <em>think</em> that prize goes to Gary. Did he tell you the joke about&hellip; uh, a man who walks into a bar?&rdquo; Jimmy frowned, but shook his head. He was listening, reluctantly. I cleared my throat to tell the joke, and adopted an uber-cheerful tone. &ldquo;A man walks into a bar. His alcohol dependency is tearing this family apart!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >There was a moment of silence before we both erupted into giggles. &ldquo;Oh man, that&rsquo;s such a Gary joke!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I snickered back, adding &ldquo;I know right?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d tried to break the ice with my family at the beginning of the vacation by telling some jokes like that, but most of them didn&rsquo;t really get it. I thought they were pretty funny, but that&rsquo;s probably because I know Gary so well. &ldquo;So&hellip; does that mean you&rsquo;ll go to the funeral?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He sighed, thinking for a moment as an old lady and a hobo began getting in a shouting match across the street. &ldquo;&hellip;okay, <em>fine</em>, you talked me into it.&rdquo; I grinned, hugging his arm even as he added &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not buying a fancy fuckin&rsquo; outfit! I&rsquo;ve got some black pants and a black hoodie, I can wear that.&rdquo;   </p>
<p >I laughed. &ldquo;Aw, thanks, Jimmy! Love ya, dude.&rdquo; He rolled his eyes and shoved me off of his arm as he shouted in protest, but he was still smiling.  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >A few days later, I was regretting going to this funeral. The priest was just droning on and on, reading off a list of stuff about Gary. Apparently he&rsquo;d never even <em>met</em> him, and it showed. He painted a picture of Gary as some curious, energetic, fun-loving child with a heart of gold that occasionally let his curiosity get out of hand. Everybody could sense the bullshit, but there were TV crews and what-not here&mdash;that had been a surprise to Jimmy and I the first time around, finding out that Gary&rsquo;s family was pretty well-known world-wide. Apparently they run some big corporation or something. I was getting more and more bored by the minute, so I finally turned to look at Jimmy. I&rsquo;d expected him to be snoring or trying to throw spitballs at somebody, but he was actually super focused on something. I tried to see what it was, but I just ended up leaning closer to him and whispering, &ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He nodded at what he was staring at, saying &ldquo;Derby looks kina jumpy, don&rsquo;tchya think?&rdquo; I followed his nod, and I could see a shock of slicked-back blonde hair. After watching for a little bit, Derby did seem to turn around quite a bit during the eulogy. Even so, it didn&rsquo;t look like he was doing anything weird, just glancing at the entrance to the church every so often. Seemed like he wanted this to be over and done with, too. I shrugged a little, quirking an eyebrow at Jimmy for clarification. He shrugged back, whispering &ldquo;Dunno, maybe I&rsquo;m just tryin&rsquo; to find something to look at.&rdquo; And we went back to listening to the priest&rsquo;s speech.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;&hellip;I am told that Gary loved Halloween, and often used it as a time to conduct innocent mischief&hellip;&rdquo; Oh God somebody kill me. I resisted the temptation to start beating my head against the back of the pew, instead just leaning my head against it and closing my eyes. Man, this was like nails on a chalkboard hard to hear. What was weird was how it was true, in a way. Gary is curious, and energetic, and likes Halloween, but the way the priest was describing him was just so inaccurate that it was almost comically insulting.  </p>
<p >Suddenly, Jimmy started tugging on my sleeve, pointing when I looked over at him. A couple of people had quietly come up to Derby, apparently, and were talking with him. They left quickly, but Derby seemed&hellip; worried? Frightened? Either way, I didn&rsquo;t really get to catch much of his expression before he turned back around. I could see him take a breath before getting out of his seat and beginning to make his way to the alter, where the priest was speaking. Jimmy&rsquo;s eyebrows had shot up by now. He leaned over and whispered &ldquo;At least something&rsquo;s happening!&rdquo; I nodded; hear, hear.  </p>
<p >The priest appeared to be wrapping up, because he said something that had the cadence of a conclusion before nodding to some smattered applause as he stepped away from the podium. Derby stepped up to the mic, clapping quietly as he said &ldquo;Yes, thank you Father Tony for those&hellip; kind, riveting words.&rdquo; I swear, Jimmy and I snorted at the exact same time when he said that. Derby took a deep breath, bracing both hands on the surface in front of him before going on to say &ldquo;The&hellip; other night, I received a telephone call at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo; He looked <em>super</em> uncomfortable, but pushed through it and continued talking, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known&mdash;knew Gary for most of my life, but the fact that he was calling me to impart what he appeared to believe to be his dying wish was&hellip; surprising.&rdquo; I blinked. Wait&hellip; what? &ldquo;Apparently, it was to have the song &lsquo;Butterfly&rsquo; by&hellip;&rdquo; he stopped to clear his throat, and said with clear distain &ldquo; &lsquo;Crazy Town&rsquo; played during his reception.&rdquo; Derby sighed, pulling out a piece of paper and consulting it while Jimmy and I looked at each other in confusion. What the hell was going on? &ldquo;He also wanted to pass along, ahem, what he called a &lsquo;message&rsquo;.&rdquo; He coughed again, looked down at the paper and said &ldquo;I shall now quote him directly. &lsquo;Tell Jimmy to&rsquo;&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t do anything with his hands, but I could hear the air quotes when he said &ldquo;&lsquo;suck it&rsquo;. And by &lsquo;it&rsquo; I mean my penis.&rsquo;&rdquo; It sounded like he started messing around with the paper, but I was too busy staring at Jimmy. He was looking at me too, his mouth hanging open slightly. Then, he broke into a huge grin and began laughing like crazy.  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >Jimmy&rsquo;s mood lifted considerably after Gary&rsquo;s &lsquo;message&rsquo;. He was especially upbeat as everybody filed past the bod&mdash;&hellip;the alter&mdash;the source of which was clear when he bent over Gary really low and I could hear a pen being uncapped. He moved on fairly fast, and I gotta admit I did snort in laughter when I saw what he&rsquo;d done. He&rsquo;d drawn fake pupils on Gary&rsquo;s eyelids, so it looked like each was pointing in a different direction, and had added a fake tongue poking out of his mouth at a comical angle. Still, it didn&rsquo;t disguise the awful pallor of his skin. I&rsquo;d been thinking about what I wanted to say, and I had settled on something simple. Leaning over the edge of the coffin, I frowned at him and said quietly &ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about this when you get back.&rdquo; And even though I knew he couldn&rsquo;t hear me, saying it out loud to his face did make me feel better. Like I had <em>some</em> control over the situation even though I knew I really didn&rsquo;t.  </p>
<p >Then it was time for the reception, which most people weren&rsquo;t invited to&mdash;though we had an invitation, we couldn&rsquo;t exactly follow the line of black cars to wherever they were going. Luckily, Jimmy jogged up to one of the adults getting into a car and asked where they were going before they left. He walked back up to me, adding &ldquo;They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to &lsquo;Smith Manor&rsquo;.&rdquo; He thought for a moment before nodding to himself . &ldquo;I know where that is. Wanna bike there?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I quirked an eyebrow as I tried to seem as inconspicuous in the jostling crowd of Bullworth kids and fancy-business types. &ldquo;I already asked my mom and dad to take us, dude. I think we&rsquo;re going to have to wait for the crowd to disperse, though.&rdquo; He nodded, glaring as a rich-looking woman in a black dress with red trim pushed past him without so much as an apology. &lt;If this was Gary&rsquo;s family, I could see why he was such a dick.&gt; Eventually, we managed to pile into my parent&rsquo;s car.  </p>
<p >My mom didn&rsquo;t talk much, just saying hi to Jimmy and chatting about her work for a bit before going quiet. When we pulled up to the house, she turned to me after Jimmy got out, saying quietly &ldquo;Peter, are you sure you don&rsquo;t want me to come in with you?&rdquo; She looked really worried.  </p>
<p >I gave her a reassuring smile as I unbuckled my seatbelt. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, Mom; we&rsquo;ll be alright.&rdquo; She nodded, smiling before she leaned over and hugged me.  </p>
<p >She whispered, &ldquo;<sub>Love you, pumpkin!</sub>&rdquo; She had said it kind of playfully, making fun of how I would always protest her saying stuff like that in public. I sighed a little as I felt the tug of my first day at Bullworth Academy, of pushing her away when she tried to give me a hug. I&rsquo;d already stayed one night, for orientation. Already been dubbed &lsquo;Femme Boy&rsquo; by the only other person at the school that I knew as more than an acquaintance.  </p>
<p >Ignoring the rock that had taken up residence in my stomach lately, I hugged her back and pointedly replied &ldquo;I love you too, Mom&rdquo; in a normal speaking voice. I pulled back and got out of the car, waving as she drove away.  </p>
<p >When I turned around, Jimmy was staring intently at a crack in the road; even if we weren&rsquo;t practically brothers by now, it was easy to see that he was hurt.   </p>
<p >I flushed, feeling the guilt join the rock in my abdomen and started &ldquo;Sorry&hellip;&rdquo; But he waved it off and started walking into the house.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry &lsquo;bout it.&rdquo; I caught up to him as we passed through the fancy gate, giving his shoulder a light squeeze. No need to say anything else. There were rich-looking people milling on the lawn, and everybody was wearing dark-colored formal wear. A few shot us disapproving glances, but it seemed more directed at Jimmy&rsquo;s hoodie and jeans rather than Gary&rsquo;s &lsquo;message&rsquo; or Jimmy&rsquo;s prank. Silver linings. Then we entered the house, and there was a soft classical music being played as more fancy-looking people milled around talking quietly. A new lump started forming in my throat and I felt the familiar irrational panic of everybody staring at me&mdash;I took some deep breaths and let it pass before following Jimmy, who&rsquo;d made a beeline for the food. As always, he was cool as a cucumber in a setting with lots of unfamiliar people. I occupied myself by searching for anybody I knew&mdash;surely some of the Preps would be here? My throat got more dry as I still failed to find anybody before a gentle nudge to my side from Jimmy snapped me out a bit. &ldquo;Hey, &lsquo;sokay, dude.&rdquo; That made me feel a little better, and I nodded at him in thanks.  </p>
<p >Eventually, I did manage to find a cluster of Bullworth kids I was familiar with. Nobody noticed when I squeezed into their midst, and Pinky continued speaking quietly. &ldquo;&ndash;what happened! You know I heard that he was killed by somebody out to claim his fortune for their own?&rdquo; Wow, what? I stifled a bark of laughter at <em>that</em>.  </p>
<p >There was a general quiet murmur of agreement. The black Prep&mdash;something starting with a Ch&mdash;said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful, the danger having wealth poses. My parents have said I might need to start taking &lt;his dog&gt; inside at night!&rdquo; Everybody in the circle gave horrified exclamations at that, but I&rsquo;ve met &lt;his dog&gt; and thought that they were probably just as unenthusiastic of a violent animal attacking them while they were sleeping than the situation itself.  </p>
<p >As soon as there was a lull, I felt it prudent to speak up. &ldquo;Um, actually?&rdquo; Everybody turned to look at me in surprise&mdash;luckily there were only four people there, so I could handle it. &ldquo;Gary wasn&rsquo;t murdered, he committed suicide.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >A moment of silence before the black haired one spoke up. &ldquo;He did? What makes you say that?&rdquo; Then, frowning, he peered at me more closely. &ldquo;Who are you, anyway? Are you a relative of his?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Sometimes it staggers me how blind people can be. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Peter Kowalski&mdash;I&rsquo;m in the same math class as you?&rdquo; He blinked, nodding, though I couldn&rsquo;t tell if he&rsquo;d actually recognized me. I sighed, continuing, &ldquo;And I know because I was there when he did it.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Instantly, all four people gasped and their eyes opened wide. Pinky leaned forward, asking in a semi-horrified whisper, &ldquo;You <em>were</em>!? How did he do it?&rdquo; Automatically I flashed on his &lt;symptoms of death by alcohol poisoning&gt; face before it was lifted on a stretcher and taken out.  </p>
<p >I scooted back, everybody staring at me not making it any easier to talk around the lump in my throat.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&hellip; look, he &lt;&gt; was a r-really close friend of mine&hellip; I, I can&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo; Their shoulders sagged, and the disappointment was palpable.  </p>
<p >Relief flooded my system when Jimmy suddenly squeezed his way into the group, his mouth full of something as he said, &ldquo;Hey, trust-fund-babies, what&rsquo;chya talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; They looked even more surprised to see him than they had to see me.  </p>
<p >Pinky, though, gave a clap of delight. &ldquo;Oh, Jimmy! I was just wondering, what was it that Derby was saying during the funeral? Was it addressed to you?&rdquo; All of them leaned in, eager to hear what the scoop was. I&rsquo;ve never cared for the preps much, since they just seem to be various flavors of terrible&mdash;but then again, I know that if I wasn&rsquo;t part of this whole thing it&rsquo;d be one of those things I would want to know more about.  </p>
<p >Luckily for me, Jimmy loves talking to people. He raised one eyebrow, snorting as he said &ldquo;Uh, yeah, pretty sure it was for me.&rdquo; Chuckling as he popped a snack from a small plate into his mouth, talking with his mouth full as he added &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see a lotta other &lsquo;Jimmy&rsquo;s running around sucking Gary&rsquo;s dick.&rdquo; The guy with the G&mdash;George? Gregory?&mdash;coughed awkwardly, though nobody seemed to notice since they were processing this information.  </p>
<p >Suddenly, a question occurred to me. &ldquo;Hey, didn&rsquo;t he also say something about playing a song?&rdquo; I frowned at Jimmy quizzically. &ldquo;You remember what it was?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Yeah, something called&hellip; &ldquo;Butterfly&rdquo;? I think? Sounds&hellip; weirdly sappy for Gary.&rdquo; He frowned as he thought too. What happened next was so perfectly timed, a large part of me still believes that Gary somehow timed that way even though he said he hadn&rsquo;t. The soft classical music was cut out, and soon after, was replaced by a clearly different genre of music. It soon became clear it was a rap song of some kind, and Jimmy snorted. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Then, a few seconds later, he added &ldquo;Wait&hellip; hey, I know this! It&rsquo;s on that iPod he&ndash;&rdquo; he cut himself off, and his expression seemed to grow more&hellip; well, something. I couldn&rsquo;t ever remember seeing this expression on Jimmy&rsquo;s face before. It had a strange intensity that reminded me of how angry he could get, but it was still a bit different.  </p>
<p >Chad interrupted our private little thought session with, &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >But Jimmy was listening intently to the song. He backed away, frowning in confusion as he said &ldquo;Hey, I gotta, uh, go.&rdquo; He glanced up to meet my eyes, and I nodded. I hadn&rsquo;t really expected him to stay very long, and he&rsquo;d behaved way better than he had been lately.  </p>
<p >He nodded back, turning on his heel before I thought to add, &ldquo;Docks in an hour, okay?&rdquo; He waved without looking back. I frowned&mdash;my first inclination was to go after and ask what was up, but I could tell he would figure things out better if I left him on his own for a while.  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >I was bursting to ask, but it seemed like he was working up to something so we watched the water for a bit before Jimmy finally spoke. &ldquo;He filled it with love songs.&rdquo; &hellip;Well that wasn&rsquo;t what I had been expecting. At my baffled face, he reached into his sweatshirt pocket and pulled out the new music player and handed it to me. I rose an eyebrow but just began scrolling through the playlist he had open.   </p>
<p >&ldquo;Butterfly&rdquo; Artist: Crazy Town ---- &ldquo;You Don&rsquo;t Have to Say You Love Me&rdquo; Artist: Dolly Parton ---- &ldquo;You Belong With Me&rdquo; Artist: Taylor Swift ---- &ldquo;Almost Paradise&rdquo; Artist: &lt;&gt; ---- &lt;&gt;  </p>
<p >As I continued, my gut twisted painfully as the pattern became clear and I handed it back. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t even name it or anything. Just &lsquo;Playlist 1&rsquo;.&rdquo; Jimmy&rsquo;s expression was, unusally for him, kind of hard to read. Stuffing the device back in his pocket, he continued &ldquo;I usually just listen to all the music, so I didn&rsquo;t even notice it, but it&rsquo;s full of nothing but love songs&mdash;about, like, a specific person.&rdquo; He turned stare at the ferris wheel in the distance, &ldquo;And a bunch about&hellip; like, not needing anything other than attention from &lsquo;em, ya know?&rdquo; Swinging his head back around, I still couldn&rsquo;t quite pin down his expression, but I could see the confusion when he said quietly, &ldquo;Is&hellip; he, like, in love with me?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I didn&rsquo;t reply imedietly, instead focusing on his face as I tried to think of what to say. It dawned on me why I couldn&rsquo;t read his expression; Jimmy almost never shows that he&rsquo;s scared. He gets afraid, sure, but it usually manifests as trying to beat somebody up or, if that&rsquo;s not avalible, hurling a stream of (usually ineffective) insults at whoever was around. But I could only recall a couple of times &lt;&gt;seeing him look fearful for more than a few seconds. The first day we were kidnapped and the time I&rsquo;d beat up &lt;which Jock was it again&gt; came to mind. I needed to tread carefully; first things first, establish the basic facts. &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t speak for Gary, since I&rsquo;m not him.&rdquo; Jimmy snorted impatiently, so I quickly added, &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not like I really know&mdash;you two&rsquo;re the ones in the relationship.&rdquo; I bit my lip and slowly said, &ldquo;But&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if that&rsquo;s the case.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He didn&rsquo;t reply for a moment. Then he let out a bark of laughter that wasn&rsquo;t very happy. &ldquo;Fucking figures.&rdquo; After that, he simply turned back to the water with his arms crossed on his knees.  </p>
<p >The silence stretched for a while before I said tentatively, &ldquo;Do you want to talk about it?&rdquo; His expression was still hard to read, even after identitfying the fear&mdash;there was more, and I was willing to bet it had to do with Jimmy&rsquo;s feelings. For all his openness, he has a really hard time just talking about it.  </p>
<p >Closing his eyes, he shook his head and said &ldquo;I should. I really should.&rdquo; Luckily I didn&rsquo;t need to interpret that conflicting message since he continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just. I knew I didn&rsquo;t hate him like I did before, but I still kinda did in a way?&rdquo; I could tell he was forcing himself, that this was hard, so I nodded encouragingly. Plus, I knew exactly how he felt. He leaned back, &ldquo;So I guess we kinda started hate-fucking?&rdquo; I kept my face pretty neutral, but frowned my disapproval. At least he was a little sheepish, &ldquo;I know, I know! But, it&hellip; I dunno, we both liked it, and I stopped wanting to break the asshole&rsquo;s arms all the time so I felt better in general.&rdquo; He turned toward me, saying imploringly &ldquo;But I&hellip; I just, I dunno, I&rsquo;ve never had somebody be in fucking <em>love</em> with me!&rdquo; Biting his lip nervously, he added &ldquo;He&hellip; shit he even kinda said it when&hellip; before he, ya know?&rdquo; I nodded, stiffly.  </p>
<p >I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to take from that. Slowly I asked, &ldquo;What&hellip; do you mean by that, exactly?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Scratching the back of his head, he sighed and answered, &ldquo;He. He was talking to these kids about, like, murder?&rdquo; I rolled my eyes, but didn&rsquo;t comment. &ldquo;Which is, ya know, whatever. But&hellip; then he started somehow talking about how you die if you don&rsquo;t kiss somebody you&rsquo;re in love with?&rdquo; He let out a frustrated huff. &ldquo;Fuck, I dunno how he said it exactly, but he said it like he was talking about <em>me</em>.&rdquo; Abruptly, he fell silent for a couple minutes. I chewed my lip as I watched a seagull drift across the sky and considered all this; it sure isn&rsquo;t out of character for Gary to make such a dramatic shift in topic, and I&rsquo;d listened to him rant enough to know how big his leaps in logic could be. Plus, he was drunk at the time, which could have caused any number of changes in behavior that we could only guess at for now. Jimmy cut into my musings. &ldquo;So&hellip; does he like me the same way he&rsquo;s into you, or something?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I grimaced, automatically replying, &ldquo;Eugh, I <strong>hope</strong> not!&rdquo; and failed to suppress a shudder at the thought. He snickered a bit, but trailed off pretty quickly. So I rushed to fill the void with, &ldquo;Honestly, Jimmy, I&rsquo;m not sure anymore. I really did think Gary was getting better, but&hellip; well.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >I didn&rsquo;t really like the music bleeding through the walls of the building, but Jimmy, naturally, banged on the door without heasitation. A little while later, Duncan opened the door and broke into a grin when he saw who we were. &ldquo;Hey! Ya made it!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Behind him, I heard one of the scarier kids shout &ldquo;Izzat that little fag you were jacking off about?&rdquo; I flinched automatically as I felt a pulse rage wash over me. Then I winced internally at my reaction; for God&rsquo;s sake, it&rsquo;d been years!  </p>
<p >Luckily it receded quickly, but Jimmy must&rsquo;ve noticed because then I heard him yell in kind &ldquo;Hey, who you callin&rsquo; a fag!?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >My stomach twisted in guilt as I grabbed him, frantically saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;m fine, Jimmy, okay?&rdquo; Christ, we weren&rsquo;t even in the building yet.  </p>
<p >He nudged me in a silent <em>Dude are you sure?</em> And I nodded, seriously hoping he would just drop it and move on.  </p>
<p >Somebody else, meanwhile, added &ldquo;Aw, shut up &lt;whoever the dick guy was&gt;! Duncan said he&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo; We finally made our way into the room, and I saw the guy light up as he noticed the cases were carrying. &ldquo;Sweet! Booze!&rdquo; I forced a smile as Townies swarmed over and relieved me of my burden&mdash;Jimmy had used every trick in the book to get me to let him bring alcohol; being casual about it, begging, even bribery. Eventually, he made the argument that the other Townies would be way friendlier if we brought something, which made a lot of sense. I wasn&rsquo;t really all that happy about it, but it&rsquo;s hardly my business.  </p>
<p >Eventually, everybody went back to playing video games and general chatting&mdash;Jimmy managed to hit it off well with Zoe for once. He even got a couple of the others to be impressed by me by mentioning that I&rsquo;d beaten Bif before. Even Duncan was impressed by that, though he had kind of fought me before. But the skinny redhead didn&rsquo;t believe him. Shoving my shoulder, he whined, &ldquo;This pip-squeak? Aw, what&rsquo;s he gonna do, <em>cry</em> on me?&rdquo; Everyone &lsquo;ooooh&rsquo;d in the way that teenagers do when they sense a fight brewing.  </p>
<p >Personally I was just glad he was making fun of my size and not my sexuality. After all, I&rsquo;d learned to hold my own in a fight pretty well by now&mdash;that, at least, I could fight. Turning around, I met his eye and replied calmly, &ldquo;I can prove it, if you want.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >A second round of &lsquo;ooooh&rsquo;s, this one a bit more hushed. He looked surprised that I&rsquo;d replied so boldly. Then a black boy nudged him and said mockingly, &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Omar, don&rsquo;t be a pussy!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Another boy, one wearing a similar outfit to Omar actually, shouted excitedly from the other side of the room &ldquo;Haha, yeah! &lt;&gt;&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Everybody quickly joined, and Omar was clearly happy to oblige everybody with the fight they wanted.  </p>
<p >&lt;unfinished&gt;  </p>
<p >~~~   </p>
<p >After a few hours, things got considerably quieter. Somebody had dragged out a table, a few boxes, some paint-test sticks, and a ping-pong ball and a few people were laughing and failing to play ping pong. Jimmy and Zoe had vanished, which was really not surprising. Which left me on the couch, trying to figure out what to do while I worked up the courage to go find Jimmy and ask if we could leave. I was debating about whether I should ask somebody for change for the arcade machines when somebody plopped down on the couch next to me. &ldquo;Heya, kid.&rdquo; Duncan let out a burp before taking a swig of the bottle in his hand.  </p>
<p >He didn&rsquo;t seem super drunk, though. So I returned the greeting. &ldquo;Hi.&rdquo; Not much else to say.  </p>
<p >For a few seconds he didn&rsquo;t say much, instead just staring into his bottle. Eventually he said in a rather belabored manner, &ldquo;Sooo&hellip; uh. I just wanna say &lsquo;m sorry for, uh, Omar being a sack of dicks earlier. Ya know?&rdquo; I nodded uncertainly, trying to remember which one was &lsquo;Omar&rsquo;. &ldquo;Ya know, about calling you a fag?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Ah, that one. I thought I hid my flinch relatively well as I said, &ldquo;Oh, him. Yeah, it&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; Turning away, I took a deep breath, trying to ignore the emotions welling up from that simple word. You&rsquo;d think that after nearly four years of people calling me that and various other names I would be used to it by now.  </p>
<p >Duncan spoke again after a fashion, though he sounded uncertain. &ldquo;Hey, so I was kinda&hellip; wondering something?&rdquo; I rose one eyebrow, but nodded for him to continue. &ldquo;Just, like&hellip; are you?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >A few moments passed before I had to prompt him. &ldquo;&hellip;Am I what?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He leaned closer, lowering his voice. &ldquo;Ya know. Like. Into guys?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Oh. That. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not into guys.&rdquo; I suppressed a sigh as I craned my neck to see whether Jimmy and Zoe were finished yet.  </p>
<p >Duncan nodded fervently. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s cool. I like girls too, man. I totally get it. Kinda.&rdquo; He scratched his head, like he wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what he was saying.  </p>
<p >I don&rsquo;t know why, but I felt the need to elaborate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not necessarily into girls, either. Sex, um, doesn&rsquo;t hold much appeal for me,&rdquo; That seemed to give him some pause.  </p>
<p >He squinted at me for a while. &ldquo;Wait&hellip; you fuckin&rsquo; serious?&rdquo; I nodded, pulling one knee into myself as I tried to scream at Jimmy telepathically to FINISH UP. &ldquo;Like&hellip; at all?&rdquo; After confirming that, yeah, I don&rsquo;t like sex by shaking my head, he added, &ldquo;Whoa. I could&rsquo;a sworn you and&hellip; well, Gary&hellip;&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I laughed a little more harshly than necessary. &ldquo;Common mistake, trust me. But no. Gary and I aren&rsquo;t&mdash;er, weren&rsquo;t together.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He nodded, swirling his drink a little. &ldquo;Yeah, no, I get it.&rdquo; After another pause, I only just caught him muttering, &ldquo;Lucky you,&rdquo; before he took another swig. That piqued my interest, at least a little. I suppose it was true that of everybody in town, Duncan was probably the only person with a personal connection to Gary other than Jimmy and I. Well, other than his family.  </p>
<p >Choosing my words carefully, I started &ldquo;Hey, you and Gary&hellip; um. Did stuff together, right?&rdquo; He glanced up at that.  </p>
<p >He seemed surprised before shaking his head and waving a hand dismissively. &ldquo;Nah, you don&rsquo;t wanna hear &lsquo;bout that.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I shook my head, turning to face him. &ldquo;No, I am a little curious&mdash;nobody else really&hellip; well, remembers who he was, you know?&rdquo; Which was true&mdash;as the eulogy showed, Jimmy and I seemed to be the only people that Gary ever showed his true self to.  </p>
<p >Plus, I had a feeling it was kind of fucked up, and I certainly wasn&rsquo;t going to get the truth out of Gary; in this loop or the next. Either way, Duncan laughed at what I&rsquo;d said, though it was more of a sad laugh than anything else. &ldquo;I only met the guy for, like, ten minutes or something. Not much to remember.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I snorted. &ldquo;Ten minutes of sex with Gary is practically enough to write a book about him if you know what to look for, trust me.&rdquo; Even though I&rsquo;d never had sex with anybody else, it was pretty easy to tell that Gary had weird sex stuff like some Jimmy has freckles.&nbsp;   </p>
<p >&nbsp;  </p>
<p >&lt;Chapter incomplete&gt;  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >After   </p>
<p >~~~~~~    Chapter 31: I Guess Jimmy Channels Anger into Lust or Something   ~~~~~~  </p>
<p >I snapped my eyes open as soon as I felt awake, sighing in relief when I was looking at the roof of my step-dad&rsquo;s car. I sat up, checking outside the window&mdash;we were coming up on the carnival. Sweet, right on time. And Mom would say her line riiiight&hellip; &ldquo;Jimmy, please, <strong>say</strong> something!&rdquo; Bingo.  </p>
<p >I didn&rsquo;t respond right away, instead scanning through the front window looking for any sign of Gary. Pete had gone over the plan last night, and my job was to make sure Gary didn&rsquo;t try and pull the same shit he&rsquo;d pulled the last couple of loops and get away. I had seen him use this route to get out of town a couple of times so Pete reasoned that the odds were good that he&rsquo;d use it this time. If he did skip town. Just had to hope Pete&rsquo;s Gary Whisperer instincts aren&rsquo;t wrong. As I searched for him, step-dad the fifth said &ldquo;Really young man, you should listen to your mother,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know this guy very well, but I&rsquo;d been racking up repeats enough to at least not hate him anymore. I don&rsquo;t <em>like</em> him, but shit, if Mom wants to marry dumbasses with lots of money that&rsquo;ll take her on year-long cruises, that&rsquo;s her thing.  </p>
<p >That was my last time to speak without Mom getting <em>real</em> mad. &ldquo;Right, sorry&mdash;Hi, I&rsquo;m jimmy, nice to meet&rsquo;chya, blah, blah, blah,&rdquo; I really didn&rsquo;t give a shit whether this guy liked me or not.  </p>
<p >Mom was a different story, though. &ldquo;Jimmy! Please try not to be a <strong>brat</strong>, for once in your life?&rdquo; I flinched. Damn, even after, like, six times of hearing that it doesn&rsquo;t hurt any less.  </p>
<p >Still, I had more important shit to worry about. &ldquo;Hey, Todd&mdash;I&rsquo;m gonna need you to slow the car down for me when I ask you to, okay?&rdquo;   </p>
<p >I still gasped a little when we entered Bullworth Vale and I spotted Gary on the horizon. I ducked down and hissed &ldquo;Shit! Slow down!&rdquo; I shifted over to the window&mdash;looked like he hadn&rsquo;t even registered the car, instead he was just doing the staring-at-the-ground thing.   </p>
<p >Unfortunately the car hadn&rsquo;t slowed down. &ldquo;What? Young man, I have half a mind to <em>make</em> you sit down!&rdquo; Something like panic started to rise in my chest as I watched Gary whip past&mdash;fuck! I was NOT going to let this motherfucker get away, not after that love-confession bullshit at the funeral. So, I opened the door to the car and jumped out. I tried to tuck-and-roll, but I was still a little dazed after ending up on the sidewalk, to the surprise of a couple of &lt;pedestrians&gt;. I heard Mom start calling after me but I quickly tore off after Gary. I felt a little better when I saw that he hadn&rsquo;t got to the tunnel yet; perfect!  </p>
<p >Putting on a burst of speed, I caught up to him in no time, and Gary only started to turn around when it was already too late. I full-body tackled him, and we both crashed to the ground in a tangle of limbs. I&rsquo;d been thinking about this moment a lot in the last few months; there were, like, five baddass one-liners I wanted to say, and a couple of good &lsquo;fuck you&rsquo;s, plus, maybe&hellip; twenty insults. But I&rsquo;d kinda forgotten that straddling Gary as he was dazed as all hell underneath me would be so fucking hot. So instead of saying all that shit I just grabbed the front of his shirt and yanked him up so I could try and eat his tongue. Damn, I&rsquo;d <em>missed</em> Gary. Like&hellip; a lot. I pulled back and hissed in his ear &ldquo;Where ya goin&rsquo; in such a hurry?&rdquo; as I grabbed his arm and pulled him off the ground. As much as I wanted to just start humping his leg right fucking now, I <em>did</em> have to go get registered for school and shit. So I started tugging him back to the car. But that didn&rsquo;t mean I couldn&rsquo;t start working on giving him a hickey while we walked.  </p>
<p >Eventually I could hear Mom yelling at me as I dragged him back toward the car. &ldquo;James, you get <em>back here this instant!</em>&rdquo; I trying to tattoo his skin after pushing through the crowd of people that had gathered around the car.  </p>
<p >Swinging him around I gestured &ldquo;Gary, Mom. Mom, Gary. We good? Awesome,&rdquo; before shoving him into the car. Gary didn&rsquo;t go quietly, though. He, for some fucking reason, started trying to get away! I grabbed his backpack, reeling him in as I backed into the car. &ldquo;Come on asshole, get the fuck back here!&rdquo; I managed to grab a handful of the back of his shirt, meaning I could slide my hands over the skin of his back. The slight shiver that ran up the psycho&rsquo;s back made me grin&lt;&gt; as I was able to fully yank him into the car. I hissed, &ldquo;Yeah, you like that?&rdquo; before running my tongue all over his ear. I knew what I was doing wasn&rsquo;t much on the technical side of things, but I didn&rsquo;t care because I needed the reminder that Gary was real, and <em>here</em>, and not fucking <em>dead</em>. By now we were both in the car&mdash;as soon as we were, I yanked the door shut before pulling his backpack off. I made sure to keep one arm wrapped firmly around his middle&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t giving him any chances to get away.  </p>
<p >It was like he&rsquo;d seized up, his arms curled up uselessly in front of him as I re-discovered just how easily I can play with his whole body. God it&rsquo;s so fucking hot. &ldquo;I&hellip; uh&hellip; take it you two&hellip; know each other?...&rdquo; My stepdad had gotten back into the car, and he was probably looking at us pretty weird but I didn&rsquo;t fucking give a shit because oh crap that&rsquo;s right I&rsquo;d forgotten how sensitive his wrists are! I rubbed a thumb over that skin as I nipped at the underside of his chin, and even though he didn&rsquo;t really make any sounds the way his body was twitching as I kept him in my lap told me that he loooved what I was doin&rsquo;.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Y-you could say that, yeeAah,&rdquo; I smirked as Gary tried to talk despite how distracting I was being. Mmm I <em>like</em> being able to control that smart mouth. I shifted him closer to my crotch so he could feel my dick against his ass as I began rubbing my leg against his inner thigh. I just wanted to get to my dorm room and be able to touch <em>everything</em>.  </p>
<p >A few seconds passed of quiet little murmurs from Gary before Mom finally piped up again. &ldquo;&hellip;did you meet Jimmy at one of his previous schools? Because I certainly don&rsquo;t remember you..&rdquo; I groaned; fuck, that&rsquo;s a boner-killer.  </p>
<p >I leaned so I could see her&mdash;she seemed pretty shocked (not, like, <em>super</em> surprised; &lsquo;snot like I&rsquo;d never kissed anybody before Bullworth) as my step-dad started the car up again. Now that I wasn&rsquo;t doing stuff to him, Gary was able to say stuff easier, and God knows he loves hearing himself talk. I felt his head tilt to the side as he thought before saying &ldquo;I suppose you could say we met in a&hellip; previous life,&rdquo; I snorted at that, punching him in the arm. &ldquo;Oh, are you telling me you can come up with a better explanation, moron?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He had a point there; I shrugged before snuggling my head into his neck again. &ldquo;Fair &lsquo;nuff,&rdquo; Guess I should answer her question. &ldquo;Nah, I uh&hellip; Gary&rsquo;s not from an old school, he goes to Bullworth,&rdquo; By now, the car was crossing the bridge and the gates to the school were right over the horizon. I shrugged at her confused expression. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a <em>really</em> long story Mom.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Finally, Todd cleared his throat and said &ldquo;Well, here we are, boys; Bullworth Academy!&rdquo; as the car pulled up to the front gate.  </p>
<p >Mom added in a bored voice &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back to pick you up next year&rdquo; before shifting to delight that made me want to vomit. &ldquo;after our <strong>honeymoon</strong>!&rdquo; I sighed; that still hurt, too&mdash;being abandoned by my family like that.  </p>
<p >I wrapped my arms tighter around Gary, though. I&rsquo;ve got a new family now. That made me feel a little better; I said quietly &ldquo;You gonna run away again?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He stayed still for a freakin&rsquo; minute after I asked that, his entire body tensed as he must&rsquo;ve been doing that &lsquo;thinking about shit super hard&rsquo; thing he does. I nuzzled my face into the small of his back in the meantime. Eventually, I felt him kina slump, sighing as he muttered a quiet &ldquo;&hellip;no.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; I opened the door and moved to get out. It was a little awkward with him in my lap, but we did alright. I even managed to remember to grab his backpack before I shut the car door and flipped it the bird.  </p>
<p >I swung his backpack on fully as I turned to listen to Miss Danvers give her opening talk. &ldquo;You must be the Hopkins boy&hellip;&rdquo; She frowned when she saw Gary standing off to the side with his arms folded. &ldquo;Smith? Are you not aware that students aren&rsquo;t allowed off-campus during the fall semester?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I answered as I adjusted the straps on the backpack. &ldquo;Nah, he was tryin&rsquo; to ditch school to go&hellip;&rdquo; I paused, looking over at Gary as I said &ldquo;&hellip;be a fuckin&rsquo; hobo in New York, I guess? I dunno. Long story short, I just saved the school a fuckin&rsquo; media circus,&rdquo; I bit my tongue to keep from adding <em>you&rsquo;re welcome assholes</em>, instead doing my &lsquo;humble in front of authority&rsquo; voice &ldquo;So, I know I gotta go talk to the headmaster and stuff, but can I maybe stop by my dorm room and pick up my uniform first?&rdquo; And I gave her my best apologetic smile.  </p>
<p >She blinked, blind-sighted by the fast talk before frowning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very rude to make a man as brilliant as Doctor Crabblesnitch waiting, boy.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I started walking toward the gates, taking a page out of Pete&rsquo;s book and nodding. &ldquo;Oh, yeah, totally. But, uh&hellip; shouldn&rsquo;t I be presentable when I meet him? Ya know, instead&rsquo;a&hellip;&rdquo; and I gestured to my current ratty jeans, t-shirt and crappy jacket.  </p>
<p >She looked surprised by my point before nodding thoughtfully. &ldquo;Hm. I suppose that&rsquo;s true. All right, you may stop in the dormitory before proceeding to Dr. Crabblesnitch&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; Here she frowned and added &ldquo;But do <em>not</em> keep the good doctor waiting! He is a <em>brilliant</em> man and does not need to waste time waiting around for naughty little boys, understand?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I nodded as our small party reached the central dorms, replying as nice-sounding as I could &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. Absolutely,&rdquo; Crap, there&rsquo;s really a reason Pete generally does this kinda stuff; I&rsquo;m a shit liar. I grabbed Gary&rsquo;s arm and pulled him away from her before she could add on anything about how badly she wants to fuck Crabblesnatch. Eugh. Why they picked her to greet new students I had no idea; Ms. Philips or Mr. Galloway would&rsquo;ve both been way better options. Gary pulled up beside me, giving me a funny look. I frowned. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He narrowed his eyes a little before saying &ldquo;&hellip;that was&hellip; <em>clever</em>,&rdquo; I shrugged. Not exactly rocket science.   </p>
<p >We were surrounded by blood-thirsty Bullies on all sides basically instantly. By now I was so good at beating these guys I had to fight the temptation to ignore them and just drag Gary into my room instead. &ldquo;Guess what time it is? Yup, time for a beat-down!&rdquo; I rolled my eyes at the empty threat, but the psycho actually responded first.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Now Wade, do we <em>really</em> need to get violent about this?&rdquo; He reached over and casually plucked something out of the side of the backpack I was wearing, walking up to him and adding &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t want to do what your dad never had the guts to&hellip;&rdquo; I blinked, before noticing the kitchen knife he was flashing in his hand.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Fuckin&rsquo;&ndash;&rdquo; I grabbed Gary&rsquo;s arm and wrestled the knife out of his hands &nbsp;before kicking it away. Jesus, leave it to the psycho to traumatize people just to win a fight I can literally win in like five minutes! Then I shoved him to the side of the ring, looking Wade in the eye and saying &ldquo;You wanna fight me, that&rsquo;s cool dude! Let&rsquo;s go right now!&rdquo; But his face was white as hell and he had started trembling.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Ne&ndash;never mind, man&hellip; I&hellip; um, I know I&rsquo;d win anyway!&rdquo; Gary had returned to stand next to me, and now all the other boys in the circle were looking at him uneasily as well. So, when Wade said &ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s bail. We&rsquo;ve got, uh, better stuff to do!&rdquo; nobody else really argued.  </p>
<p >As they trooped off, I sighed at Gary&rsquo;s smug look. Still&hellip; that <em>was</em> way faster than I could have ever beaten anybody up, so I wasn&rsquo;t exactly complaining. As we continued up the stairs, though, I said sidelong &ldquo;You know Pete&rsquo;s not gonna be happy about that, right?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Gary quirked an eyebrow as we walked into the building and our subject of conversation almost immediately spotting us. He said quietly &ldquo;What he doesn&rsquo;t know can&rsquo;t hurt him,&rdquo; I snorted at that. Pete&rsquo;s gotten so smart about Bullworth&mdash;the town and the school&mdash;that I had a feeling he&rsquo;d catch wind of that stunt sooner or later. Luckily, it wasn&rsquo;t my problem.  </p>
<p >As he got closer, Pete was sporting a very relieved smile. He even hugged Gary, saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see you again!&rdquo; He looked awkward as fuckin hell, like he was trying to avoid touching Pete at all, but lucky for him it didn&rsquo;t last long. I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing. When Pete stepped back, he was frowning seriously. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not to say I&rsquo;m not pissed at you.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I nodded in agreement. &ldquo;Seconded. Just for the record,&rdquo; Gary was wearing that blank expression that&rsquo;s all &lsquo;I have no feelings&rsquo; where it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s trying to hide all his emotions. Damn, his mind is probably an exhausting place to live. Pete looked like he was about to say something but I put a hand on his shoulder, interrupting him. &ldquo;Look, Pete&hellip; you&rsquo;re my best friend, and I love you, and I probably agree with all the stuff you&rsquo;re gonna say&hellip;&rdquo; I backed up to wrap my arm around Gary&rsquo;s arm as I talked. &ldquo;Buuuuut I need Gary&rsquo;s cock in my mouth, like, yesterday, so can we save this for later?&rdquo; Pete rolled his eyes and looked like he wanted to disagree, but he just shook his head.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Alright, alright, it can wait,&rdquo; I grinned as we reached the entrance to my room. Pete added quickly as the door was being pulled shut &ldquo;Drop him by Chem before you go to the office!&rdquo; I flashed a thumbs-up before finally shutting the door.  </p>
<p >Gary was in the middle of saying something when I shoved him against the wall and resumed trying to eat his face off; fucking <em>hell</em> I&rsquo;d missed his mouth. I pushed my hands under his shirt and started mapping the hard bones poking through the flesh on his chest and just what spots produced what movements or tiny sounds. I couldn&rsquo;t hold back a smile as a couple nails running down his side made him gasp and spasm wonderfully; I moved my mouth away from his to make sure <em>everybody</em> knew Gary and &lsquo;the new kid&rsquo; were fucking. I could distantly feel the grip on the back of my jacket tighten as he started talking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, what wasss that about mm &lsquo;needing&rsquo; my cock in your mouth?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I chuckled a little, pressing my fast-growing hard-on into his hip even harder. &ldquo;<em>Oh</em> yeah&mdash;been thinkin&rsquo; about it for fucking <em>months</em>,&rdquo; I let my tongue and teeth wander around his neck, doing everything and anything to leave marks. Feeling his chest up got harder (heh) with all the clothes in the way. I growled to myself, &ldquo;Goddamn I wanna rip your clothes off with my <em>teeth</em>, neeeeegh..&rdquo; as I started really grinding on him. After that I felt him start to reach downward&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether he was gonna undo his pants or mine, but I shook my head, grabbing his hands and pinning them to the wall behind us. &ldquo;Mmmnope,&rdquo; I pulled back, revealing a pretty pissed-looking Gary; heh, he&rsquo;s such a fucking horn dog. &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s your fault, genius&mdash;five months is a long time and I been havin&rsquo; <em>ideas</em>.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Gary blinked before smiling faintly. &ldquo;Oh? Don&rsquo;t you have plenty of other outlets for&hellip;&rdquo; he bucked his hips a little, &ldquo;&hellip;that?&rdquo; ooohFUCKyeaaaah! I hardly registered the slight amount of sadness in his voice at that, since I was a little busy dragging my crotch up and down his leg and moaning like a fuckin&rsquo; whore.  </p>
<p >But I still heard it. &ldquo;Yeah, I guess I do,&rdquo; I shrugged as I slid our hands up the wall further above Gary&rsquo;s head and kissed him gently on the lips&mdash;no tongue, just&hellip; sweet. As sweet as I could make it, anyway. Then I whispered, &ldquo;But none of &lsquo;em&rsquo; &lsquo;re <em>you</em>,&rdquo; I could almost feel his blush as I resumed trying to drink my own body weight in saliva. Even as my humping became more erratic, I kept my goal in-mind; somehow, Scarface&rsquo;d got it in his head that I don&rsquo;t <em>like</em> him, like him. Sure, that was kinda true at first. But I&rsquo;d had all that time to stew and mull over all the shit I did with him before a pattern started to emerge.  </p>
<p >Gary goes so far out of his way to make sure I&rsquo;m enjoying myself, get me to come faster, do what I want&mdash;like he&rsquo;s afraid I won&rsquo;t keep comin&rsquo; back if he isn&rsquo;t the perfect fuckbuddy or something. This time, I was really gonna <em>show</em> him that I liked him. I began slowing down before pulling away, and he started whining. I held a finger in front of his mouth, cuttin&rsquo; him off before saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wanna do somethin&rsquo; <em>special</em> for ya,&rdquo; His eyes widened slightly at that before he frowned a little suspiciously; I lowered my voice to a purr. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me aaaall to yourself for twenty minutes to do whatever your filthy little mind can imagine,&rdquo; as I backed away and gestured to myself like an offering. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only a couple rules,&rdquo; His body was kina shaking with all these little tremors as he tensed up, and with the beet-red of his face it made for a funny, adorable, and super arousing sight all at once.  </p>
<p >When he talked his voice had this nice undercurrent of tension. &ldquo;And what kind of rules would those be?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d pulled himself together a little, though I was happy to see he was raking his gaze over me like I was a slab of meat.  </p>
<p >Holding up a finger, I started, &ldquo;One, you gotta write that note thing to get into Chem,&rdquo; I started backing up, moving toward the chair for my desk as I added, &ldquo;Two, no anal or anything that&rsquo;ll risk infection like cuts, or bites,&rdquo; As Gary followed me, I was surprised to see him scowl at that one&mdash;definitely gonna look into that later. &ldquo;Aaaand three, I&rsquo;ve gotta end up totally naked by the end,&rdquo; Reaching my destination, I crossed my arms on the back of the chair and shrugged. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty much it.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Gary&rsquo;s eyebrows went up a bit, commenting, &ldquo;That last one doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of a limitation....&rdquo; as he licked his lips.  </p>
<p >Man, watching him lust after me this bad was hoooot! &ldquo;Yeah, guess not. But I <em>am</em> supposed to change into my uniform. So, what&rsquo;m I doin&rsquo; for ya?&rdquo; There were a few moments of silence while Gary tried to get his head in order.  </p>
<p >It kind of amazed me how long it took him to think of something to say. What was there to think about so deeply, anyway? Fucking Christ. Eventually, though, he nodded to himself and said &ldquo;&hellip;well. If you want to get naked&hellip; maybe you could strip down?&rdquo; then, after a moment, he smirked and added &ldquo;For me?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I smirked too, saying &ldquo;Ooh, you wanna striptease?&rdquo; If Gary was a normal person, he probably would&rsquo;ve smiled bashfully at that or something. Instead he just shrugged. I laughed, pushing myself off the chair and shrugging one shoulder with a cocky smile. Heh. Cock. &ldquo;I can do ya one better&mdash;how &lsquo;bout a lapdance?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Gary licked his lips at that before saying somewhat uncertainly, &ldquo;Sure, if that&rsquo;s what you want..&rdquo; I grinned at him toothily as I walked up and pulled him toward the chair.  </p>
<p >As I did, I said in a low tone, &ldquo;Haha, hell yeah!&rdquo; I leaned next to his ear as I pushed so he was sitting down. &ldquo;I wanna do all <em>kinds</em> &lsquo;a slutty shit for ya,&rdquo; I relished the shiver that wracked his body before he was fully in the chair. I took a deep breath, slowly letting air out as I thought. &ldquo;I, uh. Actually haven&rsquo;t done this before..&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up at that as he gripped the side of his chair.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Really, now?&rdquo; He quirked one eyebrow while I started pulling my jacket off. &ldquo;I was under the impression you&rsquo;ve done everything under the sun, Hopkins,&rdquo; Tossing the jacket aside, I started walking up to Gary and his chair as I shrugged. I was doing that a lot lately.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Usually getting clothes off is a chore, not something to&hellip; uh, what&rsquo;s the word? Savor?&rdquo; I reached behind my head and grabbed the neck of my t-shirt, slowly pulling it off while I straddled him. I clicked my tongue in disappointment when I let the shirt drop to the side and I could see he was already hard. &ldquo;Man, I shoulda waited to do all that shit from earlier&ndash;&rdquo; I squatted so my own tenting was inches away from Gary&rsquo;s and reached down to undo my pants as I said in my sexy voice &ldquo;&ndash;seein&rsquo; that beautiful cock of yours get hard would&rsquo;ve been a real treat.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >His eyes were popping like crazy and his arms were shaking as he tightened the grip he had on his chair while I slowly undid the zipper of my jeans. Clearing his throat, he actually managed to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m, er, not sure &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; is the right term&hellip;&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t answer right away, just got up and let my pants fall down a little before kicking my shoes off and pulling them down. I turned around and stuck my butt in Gary&rsquo;s lap in the meantime; I&rsquo;ve only ever gotten lap dances from girls&mdash;a guy&rsquo;d never offered and I&rsquo;d never thought to ask&mdash;so I wasn&rsquo;t totally sure what would be best to do.  </p>
<p >As I dragged my ass over his boner experimentally, I laughed. &ldquo;Nah man, it totally is!&rdquo; I looked over my shoulder, grinning at the blush that had colored his face as I locked eyes with him. &ldquo;Love the way it turns all red, ya know?&rdquo; I could feel his erection dig into me through my underwear and fuuuuck it felt sooo good. &ldquo;Ahhh yeeeees&rdquo; I moaned and let out a breath as I struggled to keep my balance. Shit&hellip; I reached down, trying to step out of the pants that were around my ankles but I tipped forward too far and ended up sprawled on the floor. &ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; Laughing, I sat on my butt and pulled my pants off, looking up at Gary from the floor. He blinked, a little dazed as I sent a smolder his way and said, &ldquo;Shit, guess I&rsquo;m pretty eager for ya!&rdquo; To my surprise, he was breathing heavily, and the shaking had gotten even worse. He squeezed his eyes shut as I clambered back on top of him; I frowned. What was his problem? I snorted at that as I realized what I&rsquo;d just asked myself. What problem <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> Gary have? I reached out to run my hands up and down his arms, asking quietly &ldquo;Hey, you oka&ndash;&rdquo; but as soon as my hand touched skin he flinched like he&rsquo;d been electrocuted. &ldquo;Shit, sorry?&rdquo; He was curled into himself now, and his knuckles were white on the chair as he shook like a leaf. Damn; I licked my lips&mdash;this is kinda the best and worst part of bein&rsquo; with Gary; the intensity. It&rsquo;s like every single time&rsquo;s a matter of life or death, and I gotta give every little bit of energy to it that I can. With Zoe, she&rsquo;s so chill we can have whole shooting the shit conversations while we fuck. And yeah, sometimes Gary&rsquo;s a little tiring, but I like being the one who makes him feel so much shit. Who&rsquo;s &lsquo;easy to control&rsquo; <em>now</em>, bitch? Gary&rsquo;s eyes flew open at the contact, but he didn&rsquo;t flinch like before, at least. I whispered &ldquo;Hey, c&rsquo;mon, you&rsquo;re okay&rdquo; and tried not to touch him. Well, more than having my briefs pressed against his boner.  </p>
<p >Gary let out a hollow laugh, but he leaned into the contact a little&mdash;good sign. Probably. &ldquo;&hellip;that so, moron?&rdquo; I nodded a little against him, and to my delight he actually started touching my chest. He was being weirdly careful, just lightly brushing his fingers over my sides&mdash;huh, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve never seen Gary be <em>shy</em> before. Closing my eyes, I shivered at the contact; damn, his hands were like fucking ice. I felt him start shaking his head slightly and saying softly, &ldquo;No.. no, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; I opened my eyes again, and he was giving his usual smirk, shaking his head slowly as he pulled back. &ldquo;See, if this was a dream you wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly so accommodating,&rdquo; I blinked. Say what now? He started thumbing one of my nipples with one hand, and used the other to brush over the line of hair that lead to my crotch. I groaned, surging forward a little to rub my hard-on on his. That made him laugh softly as he slipped the one hand into my underwear and started stroking me and <em>hhooooly fucking shit</em> I&rsquo;d forgotten how good Gary is with his hands. I moaned and bucked into the grip, hard, as the fucker chuckled and kept talking. &ldquo;Heh, oh Jimmy; that&rsquo;s one of the many things I love about you, you&rsquo;re so <em>very</em> easy to manipulate,&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t really in a position to give a smart-sounding answer to that, so I just shrugged as he worked his fucking magic. God<strong>damn</strong> how did he get so good? He laughed, adding, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you don&rsquo;t even remember that I held a knife to your throat yesterday,&rdquo; He kept stroking my dick, but the grip his other hand had on my side increased as he talked. &ldquo;<em>Or</em> that you were mad at me!&rdquo; I glanced back down to see that he had his eyes shut and was starting to laugh a little creepily. &ldquo;Haha, or that I fucking <em>raped</em> you last night!&rdquo; There was a note of panic in that line as he pressed his head into my chest. I flinched guiltily&mdash;shit, I forgot what I was supposed to be doin&rsquo;!  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Hey, you didn&rsquo;t.. uh, you didn&rsquo;t rape me,&rdquo; I frowned, trying to remember &lsquo;last night&rsquo;. &ldquo;If anything, <em>I</em> kinda raped ya,&rdquo; I reached down and gently grabbed Gary&rsquo;s hand, which was still pumping. I slowly pulled his hand out of my briefs. He looked up at me with this fucking <em>devastated</em> expression and I said gently &ldquo;Shhh, &lsquo;sokay&mdash;you&rsquo;re always doing such good stuff to me, I wanna show you how grateful I am,&rdquo; I grinned as I brought Gary&rsquo;s hand up to my mouth and started flicking my tongue over his wrist. I began nipping lightly as his hand started having a beautiful little spasm session and added, &ldquo;Besides, that stuff&mdash;isn&rsquo;t really&mdash;what <em>I</em> remember&mdash;you know?&rdquo; I slathered my tongue over his palm before pulling back slowly so there was a string of saliva still connecting us. Maaaan so fucking hot! Gary seemed to agree since he exhaled sharply. Goddamn&hellip; I was so fucking hard and we&rsquo;d hardly even done anything. I grinned as I started undoing his slacks and purred, &ldquo;I remember you playing a fucking <em>love song</em> for me at your funeral,&rdquo; I chuckled as he swallowed while I undid his boxers. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s such a <em>you</em> thing to do&hellip; God, it was&hellip;&rdquo; I shook my head as he kept his gaze locked on me while I shifted forward to rub our dicks together. &ldquo;Hhhhhmm shit, I don&rsquo;t even know!&rdquo; He was still grabbing my hand, and at penis-to-penis contact his grip became fucking crushing&mdash;he suddenly wrapped his other arm around my waist and glued himself to me as best he could. He stayed still for a few seconds before loosening the death-grip he&rsquo;d had on my hand to wrap his arms around my chest.  </p>
<p >I started running my hands through his hair as he took a bunch of shuddering breaths. &ldquo;Heh&hellip; you just don&rsquo;t get it, do you?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I was gonna disagree with him, but&hellip; &ldquo;&hellip;yeah, I probably don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re pretty hard to get.&rdquo; This was the weirdest conversation I&rsquo;d ever had while touching dicks with somebody. &lsquo;Course it&rsquo;s not I&rsquo;ve had a lot of those.  </p>
<p >Gary laughed again, and said quietly &ldquo;I <em>love</em> you, stupid,&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say anything else for a bit, like he was letting those words sink in.  </p>
<p >I rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Yeah no fuckin&rsquo; shit. Come on, &lsquo;so to keep you by my side / there&rsquo;s nothing that I won&rsquo;t try&rsquo;? That bit about bein&rsquo; arrested and shit?&rdquo; Gary didn&rsquo;t say anything, so I just kept threading my hands through his hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stupid, not fuckin&rsquo; deaf.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >There was more quiet after that, and I was kinda surprised that I really didn&rsquo;t mind that we weren&rsquo;t fucking. Usually I get impatient if someone gets all feelsey on me during sex. It&rsquo;s kinda annoying&mdash;but I could tell Gary really needed it. &ldquo;&hellip;if you truly understood what that meant, you wouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Blowing a raspberry, I said, &ldquo;Well then ya wanna &lsquo;enlighten&rsquo; me about how much of a dumbass I am?&rdquo; As I talked I started shifting a little&mdash;staying in the same position on such a small chair was a little uncomfortable. Plus, my internal clock was telling me I&rsquo;d need to get to Crabblesnitch&rsquo;s office soon if I didn&rsquo;t want to piss off Ms. Danvers.  </p>
<p >The fact that shifting made Gary&rsquo;s nails dig into my back was just an added bonus. &ldquo;&hellip;No.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I frowned, actually confused now. &ldquo;Then what the hell&rsquo;re ya bitchin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; I tried to rub our dicks together again, but it was kinda hard to hit the right spots without really being able to see what I was doing.  </p>
<p >He sighed, sending a small gust of warm air over my chest as he said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be the one to shatter the illusion&hellip;&rdquo; What the fuck was he talking about? &ldquo;&hellip;but I suppose I don&rsquo;t have a choice,&rdquo; as he pulled back, grabbing the chair again. As he sat back, he gave me this <em>look</em>. I&rsquo;d seen him with that expression a bunch of times&mdash;it was the same way that he&rsquo;d look at Pete back in the beginning, and still does sometimes. The intensity kind of took my breath away, especially how it shifted emotions so fast; longing, fear, loss, shit I couldn&rsquo;t keep track. Eventually he just snapped his eyes shut and talked to the air as he leaned away from me. &ldquo;You&hellip; you&rsquo;ve seen what I do to people I love&hellip;&rdquo; He let out a trembling breath and specified, &ldquo;&hellip;to Petey. Hell, you had a front-row seat,&rdquo; He started glaring up at me now, though it didn&rsquo;t have any bite to it with the desperation in his expression. &ldquo;Why would you be&hellip; okay with that? Especially when you haven&rsquo;t even seen me at my worst?&rdquo; my eyes widened at that.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; I thought about a few times I&rsquo;d seen Gary; one of him covered in blood and not even giving a shit, how he literally couldn&rsquo;t have cared less about me just a year ago, and how he&rsquo;d <strong>laughed</strong> as he choked me to death that one time.  </p>
<p >He chuckled darkly and curled his lip up into a sneer at my confusion. &ldquo;Aw. Did you <em>really</em> think that you knew me so well that you&rsquo;ve seen the worst I can do?&rdquo; He shook his head, snickering. &ldquo;Oh, Jimmy-boy&hellip;&rdquo; he looked at me with something like amused pity. &ldquo;Even if you took the ages of all your step-fathers and added them together, you would still be multiple centuries short of how long I&rsquo;ve been alive,&rdquo; I swallowed as we stared at each other in tense silence. I wasn&rsquo;t hard anymore, that was for sure.  </p>
<p >As the moment grew, the amusement and pity in Gary&rsquo;s face drained away. &ldquo;I still remember the feel of a knife sinking into your stomach, you know. How warm your blood was as it ran down my arms,&rdquo; The cold, matter-of fact tone in his voice was what finally prompted me to slip off the chair and start making my way over to the wardrobe. I had no fucking clue what the hell was even going on. He laughed behind me. &ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s the matter, Jimbo? I was just getting started!&rdquo; What was he trying to prove? As I pulled my pants out of the closet, I decided to just let Gary talk himself out. &ldquo;A couple times I managed to steal a taser from the police and pay one of the nerds to modify it. You twitched so much trying to get at me that y&ndash;&rdquo; But I decided that was enough.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Hey Gary, here&rsquo;s an idea: why don&rsquo;t you get to the fucking point?&rdquo; as soon as I&rsquo;d finished buckling my belt, I crossed my arms and glared at him. I wanted to know what the fuck I&rsquo;d been blue-balled for.  </p>
<p >Gary narrowed his eyes before growling, &ldquo;The <em>point</em>, Jimmy, is this: me being in love with you is a deeply creepy and dangerous fact,&rdquo; He faltered for a second, and his voice got really quiet before continuing, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to get hurt, and I can&rsquo;t afford to do that to yet another person I&rsquo;m in love with.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I nodded slowly. &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; He looked relieved for a second before I added, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s some bullshit,&rdquo; I snorted as I grabbed my white shirt, shrugging it on as I added, &ldquo;I mean <em>wow</em>. Do you really think ya haven&rsquo;t already hurt me?&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up at that. &ldquo;Like&hellip; here, remember that time I wanted to&ndash;&rdquo; I started, suddenly realizing I was gonna be late if I didn&rsquo;t leave like <em>right now</em>. &ldquo;Shit! Uhhh&hellip;&rdquo; I rushed over to my desk, yanking the bottommost drawer open and slamming a piece of blank paper on the desk. &ldquo;Here, write that teacher&rsquo;s note for Chem,&rdquo; I skidded back over to my wardrobe and started yanking my vest on. &ldquo;Fuck, Danvers is gonna hate me!&rdquo; After that I had to get on my belly and get one of the shoes I&rsquo;d managed to kick under the bed while I continued. &ldquo;Look, remember the time during the road trip that I tried to escape by, uh, seducin&rsquo; ya?&rdquo; I glanced up from the floor as I laced up the first shoe; he was busy writing the note but nodded. &ldquo;Yeah, that wasn&rsquo;t actually me tryin&rsquo; to escape,&rdquo; Quickly snatching up the other shoe and shoving it on I continued, &ldquo;I seriously didn&rsquo;t care about you letting me out, I just wanted you to fuck me, man,&rdquo; He apparently finished writing the note because he stood, staring at me incredulously. Finishing up the laces, I laughed. &ldquo;Yeah, I know. I&rsquo;m just sayin, don&rsquo;t get all uppity thinking you&rsquo;re the only one around here who&rsquo;s fucked up,&rdquo; I straightened up, sighing as I started making my way to the door.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;And, look&hellip; I know I don&rsquo;t know everything about you or anything. I mean, shit, I&rsquo;ve only been around eighteen years and tons of shit has happened to me! Can&rsquo;t even imagine how much stuff happens in a hundred,&rdquo; I glanced at him sidelong as we made our way out of my room and I said playfully, &ldquo;But I do know <em>some</em> things. Like how a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the only food you&rsquo;ll eat some days. Or how when you fuck you like bein&rsquo; the one doing stuff. Or that &lsquo;chya hate your own family so much you&rsquo;ll hijack your own funeral,&rdquo; I shrugged as he pushed the door to the dorms open. &ldquo;You wanna stop havin&rsquo; sex, just say the word. But just &lsquo;cause you did some awful shit in the past doesn&rsquo;t mean you get to tell &lt;&gt;me how to live my life. Ya hear?&rdquo; As we passed a prefect, he told us to get to class. I threw a salute his way and picked up the pace a little&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care much about Danvers having a stick up her ass over my &lsquo;disrespectful attitude&rsquo; toward the headmaster, but Pete gets this <em>disappointed</em> face whenever I do stupid bullshit. The &lsquo;I know you can do better why do you hold yourself back like this&rsquo; face that I hear parents give their kids. I&rsquo;ve only ever seen the &lsquo;Goddamnit now I have to file all this paperwork you little monster are you happy&rsquo; face.  </p>
<p >Gary looked at me kinda confused. &ldquo;Telling you how to live your life? How am I doing that?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I cocked my head to the side; what, he didn&rsquo;t get it? &ldquo;Uhhh&hellip; you&rsquo;re basically sayin&rsquo; that you wanted to stop talkin&rsquo; to me &lsquo;for my own good&rsquo; when ya ran away earlier,&rdquo; I made sure to make the airquotes around that as sarcastic as possible before continuing, &ldquo;I mean, ya think I don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re fucked up? I know you are, but hey! So&rsquo;m I!&rdquo; I sighed, looking at my feet as we climbed the stairs to the front of the school. &ldquo;I just&hellip; I dunno, man,&rdquo; Shit, what else was there to say? I looked back to him as I opened the door.  </p>
<p >Gary, as per usual, was smirking like he was the smartest fuck in the world. &ldquo;Wow, how articulate,&rdquo; He rolled his eyes as he entered the building while I held the door for him. &ldquo;Which English is it you&rsquo;re in again, moron?&rdquo; I was surprised by the warmth that flared in my chest when I saw he was acting like his usual self&mdash;it was like some mix of relief at seeing he was okay (maybe not Okay, but it was better than nothing), and a kinda competitive jolt at the challenge, and a little bit of some fuckin&rsquo; giddiness that I couldn&rsquo;t really explain. He frowned at the long silence as we headed for Chem. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, cat got your tongue? Or is your grade just that bad that you literally can no longer speak?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I laughed at that&mdash;man, whatever that feeling was I liked it. It was kinda exhilarating. &ldquo;Aw, I missed you too, Gar-bear!&rdquo; We&rsquo;d finally reached the room, so I stepped closer to him and wound my arms around his waist, whispering as I pressed our faces together, &ldquo;by the way, you&rsquo;re not gettin&rsquo; <em>any</em> sleep tonight,&rdquo; before I covered his mouth with mine.  </p>
<p >To my surprise, the kiss was&hellip; different than usual. As he wrapped his arms around me and started responding this weird tingle started to spring up on my mouth, then where he had a hand grabbing the back of my neck, and even where he was grabbing my hip. I did the usual kissing thing, but when I started chewing on his lip the tingling suddenly spiked in intensity, radiating out from the original places it&rsquo;d started at. Soon my whole body was abuzz and God<em>damn</em> it felt awesome! There would be little pulses whenever he rubbed his tongue against mine, or pressed me against the door, or slid his hand down to grab my butt. I moaned and the buzzing pulsed again when I felt him shudder at the sound; grinning, I moved my own hands down to his ass so I could rub our crotches together and ohhhhman it was electrifying and now I was falling down?  </p>
<p><strong>CRACK  </strong> !  </p>
<p >OOooowww! I groaned in pain for a bit before propping myself up and rubbing the back of my head as I tried to figure out what the hell happened; shit, and it was just getting good, too! Beatrice was standing right next to the open classroom door, expression somewhere between &lsquo;horrified&rsquo; and &lsquo;aroused&rsquo;.  </p>
<p >Gary had, of <em>course</em>, already got what was going on. He was already standing, making his way over to the teacher, who had started saying, &ldquo;What <em>are</em> you doing, interrupting my class!?&rdquo; He started spinning some bullshit story while I just let myself catch my breath. Fuck&hellip; what the hell <em>was</em> that?  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Do you&hellip; um&hellip; need some help?&rdquo; Beatrice had offered me a hand, though she looked kind of terrified about it. I nodded, giving her a smile as I grasped her hand. She&rsquo;s pretty nice; too bad she&rsquo;s so fucking boring to talk to.  </p>
<p >As soon as I was on my feet, I added, &ldquo;Thanks, Bee. &lsquo;Preciate it.&rdquo; She blushed like crazy at that, but I was distracted by snickering to my left.  </p>
<p >My scowl softened when I saw it was Pete, though. &ldquo;Smoooth, Jimmy. Real smooth.&rdquo; I shrugged, but Pete quickly continued, &ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s nine-thirty-five, man,&rdquo; as he tapped his watch. Crap, I was already fuckin&rsquo; late? He chuckled, adding, &ldquo;and you miiight wanna stop by the bathroom before you go.&rdquo; Pete was clearly trying very hard not to laugh as he gestured downward. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re, uh, kinda showing.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I glanced down to see a raging hard-on in my pants. &ldquo;Aw fuck!&rdquo; I backed out of the classroom, waving good-by to Pete before tearing it to the bathroom so I could at least tuck the boner in with my belt before sprinting up to the headmaster&rsquo;s office, arriving very out-of-breath and panting. To my delight, the clock in the office read nine twenty-nine. I punched the air in victory and added a &ldquo;Yes! I rule!&rdquo; for good measure. Of course, Danvers didn&rsquo;t like that, but whatever.  </p>
<p >As I nodded in all the right places for Crabblesnatch, I thought again about the tingling feeling. Hm. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what it was exactly, but it seemed like it was linked to that bubbly feeling I&rsquo;d felt when I looked at Gary. I rolled my eyes to myself. Why they don&rsquo;t teach people about this shit in school I&rsquo;ll never understand. Well, either way, I decided to explore it further later on. Hey, maybe Gary&rsquo;d know what it was! I made a mental note to ask him later tonight. After I held him down and sucked him off, obviously. Fuckin&rsquo; blueballer.  </p>
<p >~~~~~~Chapter 32: Let&rsquo;s (Finally) Talk About Getting Off This Crazy Train~~~~~~  </p>
<p >&lt;Chapter incomplete&gt;  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Very well, take one of the open seats. And <em>don&rsquo;t</em> fall behind   &mdash;&rdquo;    I tuned the teacher out as I heard Jimmy rush out of the classroom and Petey giggling. Then, he gestured to the open space next to him and moved his backpack so I could stand next to him.  </p>
<p >As the teacher began droning, Petey said quietly, &ldquo;I take it you guys had fun?&rdquo; I glanced at him nervously, but luckily, he was smiling. Exhaling in relief, I nodded as I began preparing the materials necessary for class. &ldquo;Oh, good. I think Jimmy missed you a lot more than he expected to.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I grunted, going through the familiar motions of mixing chemicals and lighting Bunsen burners. I was still reeling from the usual Jimmy aftershocks, so I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything to say in response. Eventually I managed to tear my mind away from replays of moaning and trembling and&mdash;I shook my head. To distract myself, I responded to his statement. &ldquo;Really now, Petey?&rdquo; What had he said? Oh, right. Ha, Jimmy had <em>missed</em> me? I snorted as I truly considered it. &ldquo;I doubt that; isn&rsquo;t he used to me not being around?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the signature &lsquo;Femme Boy frown&rsquo;. &ldquo;Well&hellip; I guess so. But we weren&rsquo;t friends before.&rdquo; That made me stop and stare directly at him while he mixed his own concoction. Was&hellip; was he serious? Jimmy sleepily muttering about &lsquo;friends with benefits&rsquo; a week or so ago floated into my memory and made me freeze. A few moments later, Petey sensed my scrutiny and glanced up, only to back up, face horrified. &ldquo;Gary, your thing!&rdquo; I glanced back down to see my beaker overflowing with cerulean foam.  </p>
<p >That was new. I brought the container closer, watching the foaming slow down when heat stopped being applied and the liquid still on the sides dripped down onto the floor. As the drips produced sizzling sounds, the teacher began screaming something. Then a flurry of activity overtook the room. I tried to ask Petey a question, but I couldn&rsquo;t find him. I frowned as I turned to peer around the gathering crowd.  </p>
<p >Suddenly, hands slammed onto my table and somebody shouted, &ldquo;SMITH! ARE YOU LISTENING!?&rdquo; I jolted in surprise, turning back around to see the teacher leaning on my table, which was now covered with steaming, slightly sizzling liquid. His face was a lovely shade of burgundy.  </p>
<p >I automatically answered, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; as I glanced around for Femme Boy. A few of the people in the crowd parted, and Petey pushed his way through, apologizing quietly and with a fistful of paper towels.  </p>
<p >Now the good doctor&rsquo;s knuckles were white as he gripped the table. &ldquo;You did not hear me <em>explicitly say</em> at the beginning of the class that you needed to follow my instructions <em>exactly</em>?!?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I corrected him, &ldquo;You said, and I quote, &lsquo;Please follow my instruct&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;  </p>
<p >At this point, Petey cut in, tugging me away from the teacher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry doctor, it was my fault! We were talking, and I distracted Gary.&rdquo; He seemed to calm down at that, instead giving Femme Boy a firm scolding as he hung his head and apologized. Privately I marveled at his infinite tolerance for swallowing his pride before everything returned to normal. He sighed as we returned to work, shooting me a disappointed look. Under his breath he added, &ldquo;Really, Gary? Mocking him?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I ignored his question, focusing on our previous topic of conversation. &ldquo;Do you really mean that?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He wrinkled his brow in confusion. &ldquo;Um, yeah? It was really immature of you to do that!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I waved a hand dismissively as I tried again. &ldquo;Not that, about the.&rdquo; I felt my gut clench painfully, and I swallowed thickly. &ldquo;About&hellip; us being friends.&rdquo;   </p>
<p >I forced myself to eye his expression as I continued working. His eyebrows shot up in sudden understanding and he said, &ldquo;&hellip;Oh! Well, of course,&rdquo; Sighing, he added, &ldquo;Believe me, if we <em>weren&rsquo;t</em> friends I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d be able to tell,&rdquo; I suppose that made sense. The next few minutes were spent in cordial silence, and I soon finished my assignment.  </p>
<p >Even after I dropped my finished beaker on the teacher&rsquo;s desk, Petey still wasn&rsquo;t done. I sighed, leaning on the table to wait for him to be done. Eventually, another question came to me. &ldquo;You wanted to talk about something, right Femme Boy? What was it?&rdquo; I supported my chin on my hand as I waited for him to respond.  </p>
<p >He looked up, distracted. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he shook his head, turning back. &ldquo;Gary, shu&mdash;just wait &lsquo;till I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo; Well, fair enough. A little while later, Petey said quietly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it in front of other people, you know?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Hm. &ldquo;Alrighty then, later it is.&rdquo; Then I just had to wait for class to be over. Luckily, Jimmy soon entered the class, handed the teacher a note from Crabblesnitch, and took the table behind us. I leaned back, rubbing my chin in mock-thoughtfulness as he glanced up at me before smirking. &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re the new kid, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He laughed at that, and I swear it made the room a little lighter. &ldquo;Heh, yeah; why, ya heard of me?&rdquo; One eyebrow was quirked playfully as he assembled his materials for the assignment. I shrugged, but I was smiling. Jimmy then leaned over and poked Petey in the shoulder, eyeing his mixture. &ldquo;You forgot the orange stuff!&rdquo; He swore under his breath, adding the appropriate liquid.  </p>
<p >The rest of the day passed in a surprisingly low-key manner, considering how high-strung I&rsquo;d been &lsquo;last night&rsquo;. I was especially surprised that no mention was made of the previous loop. That wasn&rsquo;t to say that I didn&rsquo;t notice some key differences in behavior between &lsquo;yesterday&rsquo; and today. The biggest change was Jimmy&mdash;he was somehow even <em>more</em> flirtatious than usual. I began to lose count of how many times I noticed him ogling me, and after Petey went to Math, I found myself being dragged to a corner of the hallway. Jimmy&rsquo;s erection dug into my hip as he squeezed my ass and sucked savagely on my neck, and I could barely breathe with how desperate he was being. &ldquo;Fuck, <em>Jimmy</em>..&rdquo; I found myself grasping his shirt as hard as I could. I didn&rsquo;t want him to leave, I couldn&rsquo;t handle it if he left! I kept the wining and pleading out of my voice as best I could, but it was a close-run thing. My eyes were squeezed tight shut as his teeth scraped over my throat and he chuckled.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Hm maybe later,&rdquo; He tightened his grip on my butt, moaning shamelessly as our erections rubbed together, rasping, &ldquo;Holy fuck, I wanna suck you <em>dry</em>, you dirty litt&ndash;GACHK!&rdquo; I blinked in surprise when his weight was suddenly gone.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Why are you two not in class!?&rdquo; A prefect was dragging Jimmy away as his arms flailed around. Said prefect was frowning disapprovingly at him, adding, &ldquo;Really, new kid&mdash;don&rsquo;t be late your first day!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Luckily, I managed to slip away while he was distracted with the moron. After an unending period of time in biology, I was out of my seat the instant the bell rang. I was right in front of Jimmy&rsquo;s classroom as he exited the room, and he didn&rsquo;t bother with a greeting. Fuck, having him want me this badly was an incredible turn-on&mdash;in-between makeouts, I managed to pant out, &ldquo;Dorm?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He nodded, breathing &ldquo;Oh, FUCK yes!&rdquo; I had long ago learned not to pay the school population much attention, but even I could tell we were getting quite a few bizarre looks. Eventually, though, we made it back to his room and we collapsed on his bed in a tangle of limbs and slurping noises. I&rsquo;m sure it looked stupid as hell, but my body was being flooded with tingling and hormones, so I didn&rsquo;t give a shit.  </p>
<p >&hellip;Until I heard a polite cough behind us. Jimmy, panting, looked up with a pissed-off growl, only to cut himself off. &ldquo;Hey, guys.&rdquo; The arousal did not drain away instantly, but Petey being in the room gave it a sour, guilty edge. Like a parent knocking on your door asking how your homework is going while you&rsquo;re masturbating.  </p>
<p >Jimmy wined, glancing between Petey and I. &ldquo;But&ndash;aw, come <em>on</em>, man!&rdquo; He laid down fully on top of me before pleading, &ldquo;Pete, <em>please</em>! Just five minutes?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I was just in time to see him roll his eyes. &ldquo;You already had twenty minutes this morning, and an hour at lunch.&rdquo; Jimmy just groaned in frustration before being interrupted. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, we talked about this; besides, you&rsquo;ll have all the time you want later.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I frowned, suddenly suspicious. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this all about?&rdquo; Jimmy seemed very uncomfortable all of the sudden, sighing as he got off me and slipped off the bed. I tensed&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t good. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; My mind began whirring, trying to answer my question as Petey and Jimmy made worried eye-contact. This must be what Pete had wanted to talk about earlier.  </p>
<p >Petey took a deep breath, saying slowly, &ldquo;Gary, I wanted to talk about what happened last loop,&rdquo; He maintained steady eye-contact, sitting in the chair at Jimmy&rsquo;s desk, the same one that I&rsquo;d been sitting in this morning and had Jimmy grinding on m&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t hear the next thing he said, since I was too busy struggling to keep the escalating horror out of my face. Christ, him <em>hugging</em> me earlier had been bad enough! &ldquo;Gary? Hey, you alright?&rdquo; I snapped back to reality to see Petey giving me a concerned look.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I adjusted myself so I was sitting on the end of the bed, adding &ldquo;Sorry, could you repeat that?&rdquo; Jimmy was leaning against the windowsill like he was trying to avoid looking guilty.  </p>
<p >Petey nodded. &ldquo;Sure. We wanted to talk to you about the last loop. Personally, I&rsquo;ve been worried about this for a while now, and, well&hellip;&rdquo; he shrugged, adding &ldquo;Now is a good time to address it.&rdquo; My stomach began twisting in dread as Petey leaned forward onto his knees, his calm only making me more nervous. What was he <em>talking</em> about? &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time we discussed how to break out of the loops.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He paused, during which time I felt my jaw fall open. Laughing, I said, &ldquo;Wait, what!?&rdquo; I had not been expecting <em>that</em>. &ldquo;Oh man, Femme Boy, you&rsquo;ve gotta be kidding, right?&rdquo; I snickered, but Petey&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t change, and he simply shook his head.  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Nope. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it off-and-on for a while, but after you killed yourself&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, muttering &ldquo;again&hellip;&rdquo; before continuing &ldquo;it brought the issue to the forefront of my mind,&rdquo; I frowned, recalling that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it too. &ldquo;Besides, you said you&rsquo;d thought about what happens after the loops yourself, right?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I snorted. &ldquo;Well sure, in that I&rsquo;d thought about how horrific having to live in an unpredictable world would be,&rdquo; I shook my head, scanning Pete&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;But why would you <em>want</em> that?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He tilted his head thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&hellip; never really thought of it like that before.&rdquo; He leaned back, considering it for a moment before nodding slowly. &ldquo;That makes a lot of sense, actually.&rdquo; Resuming eye-contact, he added &ldquo;But I still think we should at least talk about it as a real possibility, you know?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I raised one eyebrow. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Petey looked like he was trying to choose his words carefully, but Jimmy-boy beat him to the punch. &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t wanna, like, get older? Ever?&rdquo; He was frowning at me curiously.  </p>
<p >I felt my face go completely blank before sneering &ldquo;No!&rdquo; What the hell!? I shook my head, adding &ldquo;Why the hell would I?&rdquo; I gestured back to the hallway, the door still ajar. Jimmy moved to close the door as I said &ldquo;I know <em>everything</em> about the idiots out there. I know who each of them fucks, and on what day. I know their darkest secrets, I know how to get them to do <em>anything</em>.&rdquo; I snorted. &ldquo;Why would I want to give up power like that?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I met Petey&rsquo;s eyes for a long time. Eventually, he let out a breath and closed his eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared, Gary. I&rsquo;m&hellip; really scared of what this could do to us. To Jimmy and me?&rdquo; He swallowed, and continued, gesturing vaguely in my direction. &ldquo;I mean, look at you! You&hellip; you <em>killed</em> yourself, Gary.&rdquo; Shuddering, he added, &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see your dead body being zipped up in a body bag, or smell the vomit leftover from&hellip;&rdquo; he waved a hand vaguely as he wrapped an arm around his abdomen.  </p>
<p >I may have mentioned before that comfort is not my strong suit, but Petey&rsquo;s vulnerable expression forced me to drag up what scraps of social poise I could. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not dead, Petey!&rdquo; I smiled, and gestured at myself when he looked up. &ldquo;See?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He gave a dry laugh. &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right! You&rsquo;re not dead, Gary. I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter that yours was the first dead body my cousins had ever seen, either. Or that Duncan was the only person other than us that gave a shit when they heard you died.&rdquo; I felt myself blink rapidly at that; who the fuck was Duncan? Petey continued, undeterred. &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re above consequences.&rdquo; He shook his head &ldquo;But you <em>aren&rsquo;t</em>. And I don&rsquo;t mean that Jimmy and I don&rsquo;t forget&mdash;I mean that this stuff changes <strong>you</strong>, Gary.&rdquo; He gazed at me levelly. &ldquo;You are broken. You barely even consider other people human, and you were so stressed out by a week of interacting with new people that you committed suicide.&rdquo; I felt my grip on the bedspread tighten, wanting to argue; but I knew it was true. Petey wasn&rsquo;t looking at me with pity, at least. And for that I was grateful. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the toll all those years of consequence-free action has had on you.&rdquo; There was silence for a bit before he glanced over to Jimmy, saying quietly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak for Jimmy, but I want to grow up and go to college and vote and live my life. I do not want to be trapped in this school year <em>literally</em> forever.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Behind me, Jimmy piped up. &ldquo;Me either.&rdquo; I turned to glance at him&mdash;partially to avoid looking at Petey&mdash;and he shrugged. &ldquo;Just for the record.&rdquo; I heard Petey get out of his chair, and I whipped my head back around as I scooted back automatically.  </p>
<p>For some reason, Petey calmly and steadily holding my gaze terrified me. &ldquo;I get that you&rsquo;re scared, Gary. But we <em>need</em> you; we can&rsquo;t do this without your help.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >My mouth felt dry, but my voice was surprisingly even.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He nodded, but kept looking at me as he sat down next to me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, we don&rsquo;t know why the loops are happening. But you&rsquo;ve been here for longer than us, and we don&rsquo;t know what happened when the loops started; you do.&rdquo; My hand felt sore from gripping the sheets as hard as I was, but I couldn&rsquo;t look away&mdash;fuck his eyes are pretty FUCK  </p>
<p >I swallowed the lump in my throat and mustered up some kind of response as I broke eye-contact and looked at the floor. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; I shook my head, trying to get my thoughts straight. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not&hellip;&rdquo; They wanted to leave, and I would be alone again. Months that became years that blurred together into decades without anything happening or changing; doing everything with Pete to get him to feel the same way as I did only to be told year after year that he didn&rsquo;t; lying on my back in Happy Volts, staring up at the celling numbly as I let another few months tick by; I just couldn&rsquo;t imagine going through that mindless tedium again without being able to talk with Petey and Jimmy as equals, without being crazy....  </p>
<p >Distantly I heard the bedsprings squeak, but I was jolted out of my contemplation by a warm pressure on my back as Jimmy hugged me from behind. He murmured into my ear, &ldquo;Hey, shhh.&rdquo; I leaned into him automatically as he pulled me into his lap and draped his arm over my shoulder. &ldquo;We can help you try &lsquo;n remember stuff, dude.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Automatically my hand came up to grasp his as I heard Petey chirp, &ldquo;Of course! I&rsquo;m not about to pretend like it&rsquo;ll be <em>fun</em>, but we&rsquo;ll do our best to help, I promise.&rdquo; Tearing my gaze away from the floor, Petey&rsquo;s expression was warm, a little pleading, and along with the feeling of Jimmy breathing at my back it reminded me just how fucked I was. I love both of them <em>so much</em>; I could no more say no to Femme Boy than I could kill him, and now the same went for the moron. Petey bit his lip as the silence dragged on, and eventually he said tentatively &ldquo;How about I tell you some of the ideas I&rsquo;ve been having about it? Maybe it&rsquo;s not as bad as whatever you&rsquo;re thinking.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Behind me, I heard Jimmy grunt. &ldquo;You mean all that shit I&rsquo;ve been hearing for the last five fucking months?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Petey snorted, rocking back a little. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell you <em>everything</em>, Jimmy; and it&rsquo;s not like you listen half the time anyway.&rdquo; He snickered softly as Jimmy shrugged. He continued &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll just list some thoughts and you guys can put in your own thoughts too, alright?&rdquo; I grunted as I adjusted my position on Jimmy&rsquo;s lap so I was more comfortable. &lt;end here?&gt; Petey took a deep breath and finally began. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s three things that we need to think about&mdash;what we need to do to end the loops, figuring out how to end the loops, and making sure that if we <em>do</em> break out of the loops, we&rsquo;ll be able to function. Ensuring our mental sanity is the most important thing; I think sacrificing normalcy for the other two goals would be detrimental in the long-term.&rdquo; I blinked. He really <em>had</em> considered this a lot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not totally sure how we can do that, exactly, but I think a good start would be to be to act like every loop could be the last.&rdquo; He grimaced. &ldquo;I mean, we don&rsquo;t actually <em>know</em> what caused us to get trapped in the first place, so there&rsquo;s no saying what we might do that triggers the end. At least, not until we have a pretty good idea of what got us here in the first place.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Jimmy nodded, like that made sense. I, however, frowned. &ldquo;So what does <em>that</em> mean? What&rsquo;s &lsquo;acting like every loop could be the last&rsquo; actually entail?&rdquo; Sounded annoying and boring.  </p>
<p >Petey blinked uncertainly. &ldquo;Well&hellip; basically, acting like all of our decisions are going to be permanent. Like&hellip; instead of skipping class, we go to class and try and learn the material as if the school year really is going to end.&rdquo; He paused, looking at me evenly. &ldquo;So no suicide, or murder.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I rolled my eyes, waving a hand. &ldquo;Yeah, yeah, I get it. Can&rsquo;t have &lsquo;Duncan&rsquo; crying over my dead body.&rdquo; Whoever that was. Pete frowned, flicking his gaze to Jimmy, who I could feel give a subtle shrug. Petey chewed his lip thoughtfully and looked at me for a long moment during which I began to squirm uncomfortably. &ldquo;What!?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Finally, he answered &ldquo;Do&hellip; you know who Duncan is?&rdquo; I thought for a moment, flipping through my database of names.  </p>
<p >I snapped my finger when it suddenly came to me. &ldquo;Ah, the gay Townie, right?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >A pause, and then Jimmy spoke up. &ldquo;The guy you had sex with when you figured out you were into me. That guy.&rdquo; &hellip;Oh. &lt;delete this part?&gt;  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >A few hours later, Petey had made his excuses and departed, leaving just Jimmy and me. And, maybe half an hour after <em>that</em>, we were covered in fluids and panting, catching our breath. To my confusion, Jimmy held up a hand for a few seconds, as if expecting something. But why would he want&hellip; hesitantly I brought my own hand up. He slapped it with an enthusiastic, &ldquo;FUCK yeah!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >For some reason I found I couldn&rsquo;t help but mirror his own grin. Then we both collapsed into laughter. Eventually I started coughing, and tried to choke out, &ldquo;What brought <em>that</em> on!?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He laid back with his hands behind his head, commenting happily, &ldquo;Dunno! Just thought it&rsquo;d be cute.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >That made me snort. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cute&rsquo; is the <em>last</em> word I would use to describe what we were doing.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He chuckled too, but after that went quiet. For once I wasn&rsquo;t worried, though&mdash;I sighed, letting the calm wash over me. I contented myself with lying back and simply letting the warm feeling of belonging fill me up. Suddenly, Jimmy said, &ldquo;So, do you wanna&hellip; like&hellip; be boyfriends?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >The calm fled like warmth in a blizzard. I managed to keep myself from stammering like an idiot by staying silent for a count of five. Then, I said casually, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be opposed to the idea.&rdquo;   </p>
<p >I felt Jimmy roll on his side to look at me as he replied, &ldquo;&lsquo;Kay, the fuck&rsquo;s that mean?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Leave it to Jimmy to fail to grasp all my most well thought-out sentences. &ldquo;It <em>means</em> that I have no strong feelings one way or the other.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I kept my gaze fixed on the celling but Jimmy leaned into my field of vision to whine, &ldquo;Dude you just got done telling me you&rsquo;re in love with me after basically confessing,&rdquo; here he adopted a &lsquo;spooky&rsquo; voice, &ldquo;from beyoond the graaave.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I suppressed a sigh as I propped myself onto my elbows. &ldquo;Yes, I do love you, but I&rsquo;m not nearly insane enough to think the same applies to you.&rdquo; &nbsp;There was no way I could expect Jimmy Hopkins to maintain any semblance of monogamy, even if the matter of love hadn&rsquo;t been muddying up the waters.  </p>
<p >Jimmy tilted his head and peered at me suspiciously in an adorable approximation of one of my own scans for intent. &ldquo;How&rsquo;dya know it&rsquo;s not?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >That threw me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >&ldquo;How&rsquo;dya know for sure I&rsquo;m not in love with you, too?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >. Carefully, I responded, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;in love with&rsquo;. Just that I love you. Big difference.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Jimmy processed this information before shrugging. &ldquo;If you say so, I guess. &lsquo;Snot like I&rsquo;ve ever been in love.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I continued, &ldquo;and I know that you aren&rsquo;t in love with me because I know you.&rdquo; I waved a hand to vaguely indicate a distant future as I elaborated, &ldquo;of course you&rsquo;ll always come back, since I remember resets with you, a quality that,&rdquo; I coughed meaningfully, &ldquo;&hellip;only one other person can hope to match.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He pounced without warning, and I found myself pinned beneath him in a way that was not helping my concentration, especially not when he purred, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re sexy as hell and fuckin magic in bed, smart boy,&rdquo; which sent shivers scuttling over my skin wherever his breath ghosted over my skin.  </p>
<p >I played along with an equally sultry, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m happy to provide, of course,&rdquo; a brief pause in which we made out for several moments longer than strictly necessary. As he was pausing to catch his breath, I continued in that low tone, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll get bored. You&rsquo;ll want to keep your options nice and open,&rdquo; I shrugged and added, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll want to remind yourself what a girl is like. It happens.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >A pause. &ldquo;Okayyy, the fuck&rsquo;s that supposed to mean?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I shook my head. &ldquo;Look, the point is that I know you aren&rsquo;t going to stick around,&rdquo; I shrugged, &ldquo;and i&rsquo;m okay with it,&rdquo; and I am. I had made my peace with it. Or at least I would keep telling myself that until the sinking dread went away.  </p>
<p >Jimmy frowned. &ldquo;So&hellip; you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo; I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> just date you?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I nodded. &ldquo;Yes, and that I&rsquo;m okay with that.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Jimmy, to my horror, looked like he was thinking deeply. &ldquo;&hellip;that sounds like a challenge.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I sighed. &ldquo;It really wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >For a moment he said nothing. Then, he snorted, and sneered, &ldquo; &lsquo;Cmon, how much you wanna bet?&rdquo; He adjusted himself so he wasn&rsquo;t sitting directly on top of me and shot me a grin. &ldquo;Tell ya what, I swear I won&rsquo;t fuck anybody else until we break up. Deal?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >If he&rsquo;s really that serious about it, I&rsquo;ve gotta give it at least a bit of thought. After a moment&rsquo;s consideration, I say slowly, &ldquo;How about&hellip; a loop. If you&rsquo;re that dead-set on it, I mean.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He shruged. &ldquo;Okay, sure,&rdquo; Then he laid down next to me and snuggled into my chest. &ldquo;Mmm I betchya it&rsquo;ll be easy!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Easy for who?&rdquo; That made him laugh, and he started drifting off, which left me staring up at the ceiling.  </p>
<p >What has my life become?  </p>
<p >&lt;Chapter incomplete&gt;  </p>
<p >~~~~~~~~~~~~  </p>
<p >Jimmy held out surprisingly well. By the time we were, again, meeting Petey&rsquo;s family, he hadn&rsquo;t so much as hit on anybody else so far as I knew. Not that I actually expected him to continue this pattern&mdash;but it was&hellip; sweet of him to try. I was most interested to see how he acted around Cherily; he&rsquo;d obviously be toning it down, but how much?  </p>
<p >The afformentioned girl came bounding up to Petey the same way she had last time, giving him a big hug. &ldquo;Hey, cousin! Long time, no see!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Petey laughed,&nbsp; &lt;and the author ran out of things to say in this scene&gt;  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >Jimmy almost seemed to panic when she held out her hand for a handshake. &ldquo;Shit uh, heeeyy?&rdquo; He glanced at me, and I shrugged, at which point he took her hand. It was almost amusing watching him fail so utterly at social interaction&mdash;the few times I&rsquo;d seen him so awkward were before he&rsquo;d passed any Art classes   </p>
<p >~~~~~~Chapter ??: What is This I Can&rsquo;t Even~~~~~~  </p>
<p >I was already worried enough when Gary refused to tell me what he needed help with. &ldquo;Just a little side project of mine, Petey. Nothing to worry about.&rdquo; Then when we turned out to be heading to Blue Skies, I began to hear alarm bells going off.  </p>
<p >Nothing for it, though; the best way to figure out what Gary had done was to just let him do his thing. Eventually we made it to one of the trailers, and Gary knocked smartly on the door. A few minutes of muffled groans later, the door opened and a tired-looking Duncan said &ldquo;Clint, I <em>told</em> yo&ndash;&rdquo; before catching sight of who was standing on his doorstep. Gary gestured toward him, then stepped back and looked between myself and him expectantly as if to say &lsquo;well?&rsquo;  </p>
<p >Being the quick thinker that I am, I said &ldquo;Um. H-hi?...&rdquo; I raised a hand nervously as Duncan&rsquo;s eyes narrowed dangerously.  </p>
<p >He then took in Gary, and his expression turned blank before he laughed coldly. He began cracking his knuckles, addressing Gary with &ldquo;You got a <em>lotta</em> nerve showin&rsquo; up here, schoolboy.&rdquo; Glancing at me, he added &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s this pipsqueak? Your meat shield?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I stepped back, holding my hands up placating &ldquo;Hey, whoa, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; I looked between Gary and Duncan, who looked mildly peeved and dangerously angry, respectfully. I frowned&mdash;I&rsquo;d heard something about a Townie getting seriously hurt by a Bullworth kid recently; was Gary behind it?  </p>
<p >Gary seemed to try and compose himself, taking a breath stepping back as he said &ldquo;Actually, I brought Petey along for diplomatic purposes.&rdquo; Then, he again looked between Duncan and I expectantly.  </p>
<p >Another pause, and I finally understood what was going on. I slapped myself in the face and groaned. &ldquo;Gary&hellip; it&rsquo;s not my job to make friends for you.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Gary blinked, then frowned. &ldquo;Well how am I supposed to learn how to do that if I can&rsquo;t watch an expert at work?&rdquo; and he fluttered his eyelids in what I&rsquo;m sure was supposed to be a flattering manner.  </p>
<p >I just shook my head&mdash;looked like the job of being an adult fell to me. Again. I turned to Duncan, who had been watching this exchange with only mildly-held back hostility, and laughed awkwardly. &ldquo;I am so, <em>so</em> sorry about this! Gary is. Um. Mentally unstable, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; I saw Gary glare at me out of the corner of my eye.  </p>
<p >Duncan, however, voiced my thoughts for me. &ldquo;No <em>shit</em> he&rsquo;s mentally unstable! That fucker <em>bit my friend&rsquo;s finger off</em>!&rdquo; He snorted, expression halfway between incredulious and impressed as he began eyeing Gary warily. I suppose he must&rsquo;ve realized that perhaps threatening this person while he was in his house alone was not the best tactic.  </p>
<p >I, however, felt my blood run cold. I turned to stare at Gary, who met my gaze unblinkingly for a moment before looking away. &ldquo;Oh, did he?&rdquo; I scanned his face for any sign of denial, because surely even Gary wasn&rsquo;t socially inept enough to think that he could do something like <em>that</em> and have any hope of being on good terms with the Townies ever again!  </p>
<p >Gary scoffed, crossing his arms across his chest like a petulant child as he stared at me whistfully. &ldquo;What <em>has</em> happened to the notion of &lsquo;innocent until proven guilty&rsquo;?&rdquo; I narrowed my eyes; not a denial. And the oddly formal language, plus the unblinking eye-contact....  </p>
<p >I forced myself to take deep breaths to keep from slugging Gary in the face right then and there. I didn&rsquo;t even know what to say, I was so mad. He was expecting me to fix <strong>this</strong> for him!? In the meantime, Duncan piped up in a threatening tone &ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;n your little boyfriend can take me on just &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s two-on-one; I can still kick your schoolboy ass any day.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Opening my eyes, I turned to face Gary fully. &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >Gary&rsquo;s eyes darted back and forth guiltily as he whined &ldquo;What, are you taking his word over&ndash;&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I stepped up to him and shoved him off the small porch, and Gary was soon flat on his back in the dirt. I gave him a moment to re-orient himself, and another to get my thoughts straight, before I continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to find him, and you&rsquo;re going to offer to pay for all his medical expenses. Got that?&rdquo; He knew better than to argue, and just nodded as he pushed himself back up. I let out a forceful breath&mdash;fuck, I was going to have to go work off some anger at Glass Jaw or something&mdash;and turned back to Duncan, who was frowning in confusion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry you got caught up in all this, and&hellip; just&hellip;&rdquo; I shuddered as I thought about what Gary had done, adding quietly &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I just, I don&rsquo;t know what to say about your friend. I&rsquo;m so, so sorry.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He seemed taken aback by my apology, but nodded in acceptance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool, man.&rdquo; Then he glanced at Gary, and added &ldquo;Just&hellip; keep that psycho under control.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I sighed, but nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can.&rdquo; And then professional Gary babysitter Peter Kowalski turned around and stalked off the porch, grabbing &lsquo;that psycho&rsquo; by the arm and dragging him away. When we were a good distance away, I hissed &ldquo;Because <em>apparently</em> he needs a fucking <em>handler</em> to be let out in public on his own!&rdquo;&nbsp;   </p>
<p >~~~~~~~~~~~~  </p>
<p >&lt;lol establishing shot whats that&gt; I felt a sudden warm pressure on my back and a quiet whisper of &ldquo;Hey, sexy. What&rsquo;chya doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; My body leaned back into Jimmy without my input, and I forced myself to remember just how ridiculous this whole situation was.  </p>
<p >Outwardly, though, I simply whispered back &ldquo;Reading about what shape our universe might be in four-dimensional space.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >There was a pause before Jimmy snorted. &ldquo;Pft, what?&rdquo; But he shook his head, instead kissing my cheek and partially obscuring my view of the book. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon genius, don&rsquo;tchya wanna see what shape <em>my</em> universe is?&rdquo; His &lsquo;seduction&rsquo; voice always makes me shiver.  </p>
<p >Even so, that had made almost no sense. &ldquo;What does that even mean?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He shrugged, instead moving closer to my mouth and further distracting me by nosing my ear and whispering &ldquo;It means &lsquo;put down the book so we can fuck&rsquo;, smart guy.&rdquo; Well I could hardly argue with that logic. The next minute or so passed in typical fashion, with Jimmy slipping onto my lap so we could make out more readily.  </p>
<p >But I frowned when I moved to wrap an arm around him and felt him holding something behind his back. I pulled back a bit, whispering &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that in your hand?&rdquo; so as not to upset the librarian.  </p>
<p >Out of the corner of my eye, I tracked Jimmy&rsquo;s expression&mdash;his eyes flew open, and he flinched a bit. &ldquo;Aw, man&hellip;&rdquo; then he grinned sheepishly and moved his hand so it was in front of him. &ldquo;I, uh, wanted to kinda surprise you,&rdquo; He was holding a slightly-wilted bouquet of flowers in his hand.  </p>
<p >I snorted and rolled my eyes. &ldquo;Come on Jimmy, since when do I charge for a make out session?&rdquo; I knew how it worked&mdash;if somebody else wants to kiss you, in Bullworth you need to play cool and act like you have some sort of standards. Most of it&rsquo;s just pointless posturing, espescially with guys, but it&rsquo;s all part of the game people play.  </p>
<p >But Jimmy pulled a whut-wat-duh look. &ldquo;Huh? No, I just&hellip; I just thought you&rsquo;d like &lsquo;em. Ya know&hellip;&rdquo; he scratched the back of his head and blushed harder than I&rsquo;d seen in a while &ldquo;I, um. Saw them and thought about ya. So. Well.&rdquo; &lt;OH GOD THIS IS SUCH GIRL PORN&gt;  </p>
<p >That gave me pause. Examining the flowers more closely, I noticed they were actually a bizarre mixture of dandelions,    nasturtiums   , and miner&rsquo;s lettuce. Raising an eyebrow, I commented &ldquo;Interesting mix you&rsquo;ve got there.&rdquo; Truth be told I wasn&rsquo;t sure how exactly to react to this. Was he trying to bribe me? I couldn&rsquo;t see why he would feel the need to&mdash;I would do anything he wanted if he asked. Hell, I was trying my best at Petey&rsquo;s &lsquo;make friends with people who aren&rsquo;t us&rsquo; thing, and I don&rsquo;t even get oral sex from him!  </p>
<p >So I focused and did what I do best; tried to read Jimmy&rsquo;s intentions. He laughed quietly, kissing me softly on the mouth. &ldquo;Yeah, I heard somewhere you can actually eat these. Which, I dunno, kinda made me think about &lsquo;chya. Like, how practical &lsquo;n smart you are, ya know?&rdquo; Well that was&hellip; unexpected. Even as my heart sped up I frowned and tried to analyze what exactly this meant; did he expect me to give him something in return, or some sort of favor? Again, though&mdash;there was almost nothing I wouldn&rsquo;t do for him if he&rsquo;d asked. I opened my mouth against his, snaking my arms to pull him closer as I thought. Maybe he doesn&rsquo;t realize the extent of his power? But Petey does and he exercises his control over me all the time, so Jimmy must be aware that he has at least a similar degree of influence. As we separated a little to get more air, I heard the librarian give the fifteen-minute warning that the library would be closing. Jimmy, panting quietly, dipped his head to my neck and began working the magic that already had me feeling like my skin was crackling with electricity. For some reason, he wouldn&rsquo;t drop the bundle of plants, instead brushing the knuckles of that hand up and down my side. But as he did so he murmured &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon psycho, cut it out!&rdquo;&lt;moveforward for time&gt;  </p>
<p >I frowned in confusion even as I slipped my hands into his shirt and replied in a whisper &ldquo;Cut what out?&rdquo; I tensed at a quick nip applied to a spot a bit below my ear and let out an involuntary &ldquo;Nnnm!&rdquo;  </p>
<p >His grin was evident from the way his mouth moved against my throat. &ldquo;Sensitive spot?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I shrugged, made a mental note to consider it later before asking again &ldquo;Stop what? What am I doing?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He chuckled and I twitched again as he sucked on the same spot he had before, drawing it in and teething it and fuck it was all I could do to bite back a moan. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not doin&rsquo; it <em>now</em>.&rdquo; A hand trailed a little teasingly against my thigh before he cut through the bullshit and pressed, hard, against my dick.  </p>
<p >I don&rsquo;t know what it was about that moment&mdash;the combination of Jimmy&rsquo;s branding efforts and the pressure applied to my tip, plus the thought that he had done something <em>romantic</em> for me, maybe something about how he was trying to pleasure me without even expecting something in return&mdash;but the end result was that I tightened my grip on him and let out an &ldquo;uuuHHHHhhh~&rdquo; that was surprisingly loud. It wasn&rsquo;t a scream or anything, but in a quiet library anything in normal speaking range feels like a shout. I wasn&rsquo;t paying much attention to that at the time, though, since I was too busy shuddering as I jizzed my Goddamn pants right then and there.  </p>
<p >For a few moments, there was only the sound of my heavy breathing and the distant sounds of a page being turned. At first it was a little tense&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t relish the idea of some rando sticking their head where it didn&rsquo;t belong. But then my embarrassment caught up with me as Jimmy started snickering. &ldquo;Holy shit did you seriously!&ndash;&rdquo;  </p>
<p >&ldquo;Shut it, moron.&rdquo; That didn&rsquo;t stop him laughing, but he did lower the volume a little. I distracted myself by examining my crotch. It wasn&rsquo;t&hellip; <em>too</em> noticeable. Not like there was a ton of fluid to go around.  </p>
<p >Jimmy snickered for a little longer, but ultimately climbed down and tugged on my arm. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s get goin&rsquo;. This place is fucking dead, anyhow.&rdquo; As we filed out with the rest of the Nerds, Jimmy chit-chatted about his day aimlessly. He was doing well in chemistry, so much so that &lt;the teacher&gt; asked him to lead a group&mdash;but it had been frustrating to get the other students to listen to him. He scowled, staring at his feet as he walked. &ldquo;I mean, I been at this a long fucking time. It&rsquo;s just old at this point!&rdquo; Kicking a can out of his way, he added &ldquo;Just &lsquo;cause I like hitting people and shit doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m stupid&hellip;&rdquo; His dejected expression ignited the familiar burn of anger in my gut&mdash;I made a quick mental note to find out who&rsquo;d been in that group.  </p>
<p >In the meantime, I shook my head, catching his attention. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid jealousy is an ugly creature, Jimmy-boy.&rdquo; I gave a deep sigh as he blinked in confusion.  </p>
<p >After a moment, he snorted, rolled his eyes. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll bite, psycho.&rdquo; Adopting a patronizing tone, he asked &ldquo; &lsquo;What&rsquo;dya mean by thaaat?&rsquo;&rdquo; But the half-smile that tugged at his mouth belied his amusement.  </p>
<p >I smiled too&mdash;it&rsquo;s always sweet of him to play along. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you asked!&rdquo; We made our way toward a forgotton corner of the &lt;dorm courtyard&gt; as I explained. &lt;wait shouldn&rsquo;t gary change his pants&gt;&ldquo;See, people like you, Jimmy.&rdquo; I began counting off as I spoke &ldquo;You exude confi&mdash;er, you&rsquo;re&hellip;&rdquo; I sighed, trying to think of a simpler term to clear up the confusion on his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re supremely confident.&rdquo; That worked, so I continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re funny, sociable, and strong&mdash;a quality that, rightly or not, is highly valued in our sink-or-swim school.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He&rsquo;d nodded to each of these qualities, and grudgingly shrugged at my last observation. &ldquo;I guess, but what&rsquo;re the Nerds all mad at me for? They&rsquo;re all smarter than me.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I smirked at that; utterly predictable as always. Tapping the side of my head, I asked &ldquo;But <em>are</em> they, Jimmy? Are they really?&rdquo; Whut-wat-duh classic came roaring back, and I shrugged. &ldquo;Think about it&mdash;when you showed up at the beginning of the year, all signs pointed to you being some dropout loser with a temper. Somebody destined for detention and remedial classes.&rdquo; I gestured up and down at him. &ldquo;But when you show up, not only are you a strong fighter, you&rsquo;re also a well-behaved student who&rsquo;s funny <em>and</em> who has the gall to show the Nerds up at what they do best&mdash;academics.&rdquo; I shrugged as the gears turned in his head. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be a genius to put that together.&rdquo;  </p>
<p >He was quiet for a few moments before snorting &ldquo;Psh, but I&rsquo;m no fuckin&rsquo; genius. And I&rsquo;m not, like, tryin&rsquo; to muscle in on their turf or anything. The class has room for me and stuff, right?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >This was the first time Petey had tried to use spray-paint before. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >To my surprise, the black Bully&mdash;Ethan, I reminded myself&mdash;stopped to look at the image along with Petey and I. He tilted his head and asked &ldquo;The heck is that?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >I nearly slapped myself in the face. <em>Star Wars</em> is literally one of the most recognizable movies of all time&mdash;how could he not tell what it was? But Petey replied before I had the chance to say anything. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it feel like to you?&rdquo;  </p>
<p >The boy blinked, but considered the image once again. After studying it for a while, he shrugged dismissively. &ldquo;Dunno, man. Those Westerns always seemed pretty fucked up to me, yaknow?&rdquo; And walked away. It took everything I had not to punch him.  </p>
<p >~~~  </p>
<p >To my surprise, the mural did not become covered by tags as the weeks wore on. Instead, the tags spread over the rest of the room, like some horrible rash. Soon, even the arcade games had some tags. When I asked Petey about it, even he was puzzled. &ldquo;Honestly, I dunno. I expected somebody to write over it from the start, you know?&rdquo;  </p>
